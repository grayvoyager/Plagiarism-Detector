      "to be his duty, and in no act of his life was there ever a stain of dishonor or of meanness.\n",

      "we think about is the wonderful deeds of Gulliver in the land of the Lilliputians. Do not think\n",
      "such people are impossible, for did not Stanley, the explorer, find in Africa a race of dwarfs\n",
      "so little that he called them pygmies? And perhaps when some of our young readers grow up,\n",
      "they, too, may discover small folks in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to the \"Arabian Nights,\" from which we give you three choice stories, you ought to\n",
      "know the way they came to be told. Once upon a time, a Sultan of Arabia thought that all women\n",
      "were of not much use, so every day he married a new wife, and before twenty-four hours were\n",
      "over he ordered that she have her head cut off. One brave woman thought of a clever plan by\n",
      "which she could end this cruelty. She went to the palace and offered to marry the Sultan, and\n",
      "that night she began to tell him such fascinating stories that when morning came he still wished\n",
      "to hear more. He commanded that she should not be beheaded until all her stories were told.\n",
      "Then for a thousand and one nights, night after night, she gave him fresh stories, and by the\n",
      "end of that time the Sultan had fallen very much in love with her. Naturally, they lived happily\n",
      "forever after. Perhaps these three stories which we have selected will compel you to seek out\n",
      "all the rest, and if you do, we are quite sure you will not wonder that the brave lady won\n",
      "the heart of the wicked Sultan and made him good.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" of Homer, we have given you some soul-stirring happenings.\n",
      "Several thousand years ago these stories were sung by a blind minstrel named Homer. Some day\n",
      "you may read Homer's sublime poetry in the original Greek, and the selections which we give\n",
      "you will help you to remember the stories when you are struggling with that difficult language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parts of the old favorite \"Robinson Crusoe\" follow the Grecian tales, and we trust its simple\n",
      "language will make the little ones love it more than ever. You will remember that Defoe wrote\n",
      "this nearly two hundred years ago. Everybody liked long stories in those days, but we have\n",
      "all heard children of to-day ask when a somewhat lengthy book would end, no matter how interesting,\n",
      "and many grown-ups are guilty of reading the close of a story before they have gone very far\n",
      "in it. So with that in mind we have put down in brief form most of Robinson Crusoe's important\n",
      "adventures during his twenty-eight years on the desert island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we also give three splendid stories from Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales,\" which were supposedly\n",
      "told to one another by a party of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. According to our gentle\n",
      "author, who was one of them, they stopped over night at a house in England called the Tabard\n",
      "Inn, and here they passed the hours repeating fine stories. Afterward Chaucer wrote these down\n",
      "in a book in quaint old English. One might look at these words all day long and not know in\n",

      "\n",
      "This story read by the little New York boy last week has been read by many little boys in Iowa,\n",
      "and by many little girls in Georgia. It tells about an orphan boy who was \"bound out\" to a\n",
      "farmer who treated him cruelly. He ran away to the Rocky Mountain region, where he had many\n",
      "adventures with robbers and Indians and blizzards. He was strong and heroic; he could shoot\n",

      "\n",
      "This, as I have said, is a modern story. It does not tell the reader to be truthful and good.\n",
      "It just tells him a story of thrilling adventures and daring escapes from danger. But the old-fashioned\n",

      "\n",
      "I will tell you all about the old-fashioned stories in a moment; but I must remind you that\n",
      "these old stories were written about a hundred years ago. They were usually written to teach\n",
      "a moral lesson. Dear old John Aikin, or his sister Anna Letitia Barbauld, or Maria Edgeworth,\n",
      "or Jane Taylor would say some morning--at any rate, so it seems to me--\"I will write a story\n",
      "to-day to teach boys and girls to be industrious.\" And so \"Busy Idleness\" was written. Or one\n",
      "of these old authors would decide to write a story the main object of which was to teach little\n",
      "girls not to be too curious, and so \"The Inquisitive Girl\" was written. Both of these stories,\n",
      "and many others equally good, are found in this volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could really tell you many interesting things about these old-fashioned stories but I will\n",
      "do something better--urge you to read them yourself. They are quaint, delightful, and entertaining\n",
      "stories, besides teaching a moral. You boys and girls should read every one of them, and then\n",
      "read them again, out loud, to your mothers or to anybody else who will listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among all the old-fashioned stories in this volume I find only one that seems to me \"really\n",

      "a giant so tall that \"he was obliged to climb up a ladder to comb his own hair.\" But this bit\n",
      "of humor is not so good as a very modern nonsense-story entitled \"The Giant's Shoes,\" which\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Giant slept for three weeks at a time, and two days after he woke his breakfast was brought\n",
      "to him, consisting of bright brown horses sprinkled on his bread and butter. Besides his boots,\n",
      "the Giant had a pair of shoes, and in one of them his wife lived when she was at home; on other\n",
      "occasions she lived in the other shoe. She was a sensible, practical kind of woman, with two\n",
      "wooden legs and a clothes-horse, but in other respects not rich. The wooden legs were kept\n",
      "pointed at both ends, in order that if the Giant were dissatisfied with his breakfast, he might\n",
      "pick up any stray people that were within reach, using his wife as a fork; this annoyed the\n",
      "inhabitants of the district, so that they built their church in a southwesterly direction from\n",
      "the castle, behind the Giant's back, that he might not be able to pick them up as they went\n",
      "in. But those who stayed outside to play pitch-and-toss were exposed to great danger and sufferings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With him lived his niece, a housekeeper, and a man who looked after Quixada's farm and his\n",
      "one old white horse, which, though its master imagined it to be an animal of great strength\n",
      "and beauty, was really as lean as Quixada himself and as broken down as any old cab horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quixada had nothing in the world to do in the shape of work, and so, his whole time was taken\n",
      "up in reading old books about knights and giants, and ladies shut up in enchanted castles by\n",
      "wicked ogres. In time, so fond did he become of such tales that he passed his days, and even\n",
      "the best part of his nights, in reading them. His mind was so wholly taken up in this way that\n",
      "at last he came to believe that he himself lived in a land of giants and of ogres, and that\n",
      "it was his duty to ride forth on his noble steed, to the rescue of unhappy Princesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lumber-room of Quixada's house there had lain, ever since he was born, a rusty old suit\n",
      "of armor, which had belonged to his great-grandfather. This was now got out, and Quixada spent\n",
      "many days in polishing and putting it in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there was no more than half of the helmet to be found, and a knight cannot ride\n",
      "forth without a helmet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Quixada made the other half of strong pasteboard; and to prove that it was strong enough,\n",
      "when finished, he drew his sword and gave the helmet a great slash. Alas! a whole week's work\n",
      "was ruined by that one stroke; the pasteboard flew into pieces. This troubled Quixada sadly,\n",
      "but he set to work at once and made another helmet of pasteboard, lining it with thin sheets\n",
      "of iron, and it looked so well that, this time, he put it to no test with his sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that his armor was complete, it occurred to him that he must give his horse a name--every\n",
      "knight's horse should have a good name--and after four days thought he decided that \"Rozinante\"\n",
      "would best suit the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, for himself, after eight days of puzzling, he resolved that he should be called Don Quixote\n",
      "de la Mancha.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was but one thing more. Every knight of olden time had a lady, whom he called the Mistress\n",
      "of his Heart, whose glove he wore in his helmet; and if anybody dared to deny that this lady\n",
      "was the most beautiful woman in the whole world, then the knight made him prove his words by\n",
      "fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was necessary that Don Quixote should select some lady as the Mistress of his Heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near La Mancha there lived a stout country lass, for whom some years before Don Quixote had\n",
      "had a kind of liking. Who, therefore, could better take the place of Mistress of his Heart?\n",
      "To whom could he better send the defeated knights and ogres whom he was going out to fight?\n",
      "It was true that her name. Aldonza Lorenzo, did not sound like that of a Princess or lady of\n",
      "high birth; so he determined in future to call her Dulcinea del Toboso. No Princess could have\n",
      "a sweeter name!\n",
      "\n",
      "All being now ready, one morning Don Quixote got up before daylight, and without saying a word\n",
      "to anybody, put on his armor, took his sword, and spear, and shield, saddled \"Rozinante,\" and\n",
      "started on his search for adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before he had gone very far, a dreadful thought struck him. He had not been knighted! Moreover,\n",
      "he had read in his books that until a knight had done some great deed, he must wear white armor,\n",
      "and be without any device or coat of arms on his shield. What was to be done? He was so staggered\n",
      "by this thought that he almost felt that he must turn back. But then he remembered that he\n",
      "had read how adventurers were sometimes knighted by persons whom they happened to meet on the\n",
      "road. And as to his armor, why, he thought he might scour and polish that till nothing could\n",
      "be whiter. So he rode on, letting \"Rozinante\" take which road he pleased, that being, he supposed,\n",
      "as good a way as any of looking for adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "All day he rode, to his sorrow without finding anything worth calling an adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last as evening began to fall, and when he and his horse were both very weary, they came\n",
      "in sight of an inn. Don Quixote no sooner saw the inn than he fancied it to be a great castle,\n",
      "and he halted at some distance from it, expecting that, as in days of old, a dwarf would certainly\n",
      "appear on the battlements, and, by sounding a trumpet, give notice of the arrival of a knight.\n",
      "But no dwarf appeared, and as \"Rozinante\" showed great haste to reach the stable, Don Quixote\n",
      "began to move towards the inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment it happened that a swineherd in a field near at hand sounded his horn to bring\n",
      "his herd of pigs home to be fed. Don Quixote, imagining that this must be the dwarf at last\n",
      "giving notice of his coming, rode quickly up to the inn door, beside which it chanced that\n",
      "there stood two very impudent young women, whom the Knight imagined to be two beautiful ladies\n",
      "taking the air at the castle gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonished at the sight of so strange a figure, and a little frightened, the girls turned to\n",
      "run away. But Don Quixote stopped them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beseech ye, ladies, do not fly,\" he said. \"I will harm no one, least of all maidens of rank\n",
      "so high as yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And much more he said, whereat the young women laughed so loud and so long that Don Quixote\n",
      "became very angry, and there is no saying what he might not have done had not the innkeeper\n",
      "at that moment come out. This innkeeper was very fat and good-natured, and anxious not to offend\n",
      "anybody, but even he could hardly help laughing when he saw Don Quixote. However, he very civilly\n",
      "asked the Knight to dismount and offered him everything that the inn could provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote being by this time both tired and hungry, with some difficulty got off his horse\n",
      "and handed it to the innkeeper (to whom he spoke as governor of the castle), asking him to\n",
      "take the greatest care of \"Rozinante,\" for in the whole world there was no better steed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the landlord returned from the stable, he found Don Quixote in a room, where, with the\n",
      "help of the two young women, he was trying to get rid of his armor. His back and breastplates\n",
      "had been taken off, but by no means could his helmet be removed without cutting the green ribbons\n",
      "with which he had tied it on, and this the Knight would not allow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing for it, therefore, but to keep his helmet on all night, and to eat and drink\n",
      "in it, which was more than he could do without help. However, one of the young women fed him,\n",
      "and the innkeeper having made a kind of funnel, through it poured the wine into his mouth,\n",
      "and Don Quixote ate his supper in great peace of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was but one thing that still vexed him. He had not yet been knighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this subject he thought long and deeply, and at last he asked the innkeeper to come with\n",
      "him to the stable. Having shut the door, Don Quixote threw himself at the landlord's feet,\n",
      "saying, \"I will never rise from this place, most valorous Knight, until you grant me a boon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The innkeeper was amazed, but as he could not by any means make Don Quixote rise, he promised\n",
      "to do whatever was asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, noble sir,\" said Don Quixote, \"the boon which I crave is that to-morrow you will be\n",
      "pleased to grant me the honor of knighthood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord, when he heard such talk, thought that the wisest thing he could do was to humor\n",
      "his guest, and he readily promised. Thereupon Don Quixote very happily rose to his feet, and\n",
      "after some further talk he said to the innkeeper that this night he would \"watch his armor\"\n",
      "in the chapel of the castle, it being the duty of any one on whom the honor of knighthood was\n",
      "to be conferred, to stand on his feet in the chapel, praying, until the morning. The innkeeper,\n",
      "thinking that great sport might come of this, encouraged Don Quixote, but as his own chapel\n",
      "had lately--so he said--been pulled down in order that a better might be built, he advised\n",
      "Don Quixote to watch that night in the courtyard. This was \"lawful in a case where a chapel\n",
      "was not at hand. And in the morning,\" he said, \"I will knight you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any money?\" then asked the innkeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a penny,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I never yet read of any knight who carried money with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are greatly mistaken,\" answered the innkeeper. \"Most knights had squires, who carried\n",
      "their money and clean shirts and other things. But when a knight had no squire, he always carried\n",
      "his money and his shirts, and salve for his wounds, in a little bag behind his saddle. I must\n",
      "therefore advise you never in future to go anywhere without money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote promised to remember this. Then taking his armor, he went into the inn yard and\n",
      "laid it in a horse-trough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backwards and forwards, spear in hand, he marched in the moonlight, very solemnly keeping his\n",
      "eyes on his armor, while the innkeeper's other guests, laughing, looked on from a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it happened that a carrier who lodged at the inn came into the yard to water his mules,\n",
      "and this he could not do while the armor lay in the horse-trough. As Don Quixote saw the man\n",
      "come up, \"Take heed, rash Knight,\" he cried. \"Defile not by a touch the armor of the most brave\n",
      "knight-errant that ever wore a sword.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the mule-driver took no notice of Don Quixote. He picked up the armor and threw it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote no sooner saw this than, raising his eyes to heaven, and calling on his Lady Dulcinea\n",
      "del Toboso, he lifted up his spear with both hands and gave the mule-driver such a whack over\n",
      "the head that the man fell down senseless. Then, picking up his armor and putting it back in\n",
      "the horse-trough, he went on with his march, taking no further notice of the poor mule-driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon up came another carrier who also wanted to water his mules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word did Don Quixote say this time, but he lifted up his spear and smote so heavily that\n",
      "he broke the man's head in three or four places. The poor wretch made such an outcry that all\n",
      "the people in the inn came running, and the friends of the two carriers began to pelt Don Quixote\n",
      "with stones. But drawing his sword, and holding his shield in front of him, he defied them\n",
      "all, crying, \"Come on, base knaves! Draw nearer if you dare!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord now came hurrying up and stopped the stone-throwing; then, having calmed Don Quixote,\n",
      "he said that there was no need for him to watch his armor any longer; to finish the ceremony\n",
      "it would now be enough if he were touched on the neck and shoulders with a sword. Don Quixote\n",
      "was quite satisfied, and prayed the innkeeper to get the business over as quickly as possible,\n",
      "\"for,\" said he, \"if I were but knighted, and should see myself attacked, I believe that I should\n",
      "not leave a man alive in this castle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The innkeeper, a good deal alarmed at this, and anxious to get rid of him, hurried off and\n",
      "got the book in which he kept his accounts, which he pretended was a kind of book of prayer.\n",
      "Having also brought the two young women, and a boy to hold a candle, he ordered Don Quixote\n",
      "to kneel. Then muttering from his book, as if he were reading, he finished by giving Don Quixote\n",
      "a good blow on the neck, and a slap on the back, with the flat of a sword. After this, one\n",
      "of the young women belted the sword round the newly made knight's waist, while the other buckled\n",
      "on his spurs, and having at once saddled \"Rozinante.\" Don Quixote was ready to set out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The innkeeper was only too glad to see him go, even without paying for his supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW DON QUIXOTE RESCUED ANDRES; AND HOW HE RETURNED HOME\n",
      "\n",
      "As he rode along in the early morning light, Don Quixote began to think that it would be well\n",
      "that he should return home for a little, there to lay in a stock of money and of clean shirts,\n",
      "and he turned his willing horse's head in the direction of his village.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ere he had gone far on his way, coming from a thicket he fancied that he heard cries of\n",
      "distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly these are the moans of some poor creature in want of help,\" thought Don Quixote.\n",
      "\"I thank Heaven for so soon giving me the chance to perform my duty as a knight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he rode quickly towards the sounds. No sooner had he reached the wood than he saw a horse\n",
      "tied to a tree, and bound to another was a lad of fifteen, all naked above the waist. By his\n",
      "side stood a countryman beating him with a strap, and with every blow calling out, \"I'll teach\n",
      "you to keep your eyes open, you young scamp. I'll teach you to keep your mouth shut.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy howled with pain. Quickly Don Quixote rode up to the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir Knight,\" said he angrily, \"I would have thee to know that it is an unworthy act to strike\n",
      "one who cannot defend himself. Mount thy steed, therefore, take thy spear, and I will teach\n",
      "thee that thou art a coward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The countryman gave himself up for lost, and he gasped out very humbly that the boy was his\n",
      "servant, through whose carelessness many of the sheep that he should have watched had been\n",
      "lost, and that therefore he was giving him a sound beating. \"And,\" said he, \"because I beat\n",
      "him for his carelessness, he says I do it to cheat him out of his wages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" shouted Don Quixote, \"do you dare to lie to me? By the sun above us, I have a mind\n",
      "to run you through with my spear. Pay the boy this instant, and let him go free. What does\n",
      "he owe you, boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy said that the man owed him nine months' wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pay at once, you scoundrel, unless you want to be killed,\" roared Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor man, trembling with fear, said that there was a mistake; he did not owe nearly so\n",
      "much, and besides, he had no money with him. But if Andres would go home with him he would\n",
      "pay every penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go home with him!\" cried the boy. \"I know a trick worth two of that. No sooner will he have\n",
      "me home than he'll take the skin off me. No, no, not I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will not dare to touch you,\" said the Knight. \"I command him, and that is enough. If he\n",
      "swears by his order of knighthood to do this thing, I will let him go, and he will pay you\n",
      "your wages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I will,\" said the man. \"Come along with me. Andres, and I swear I'll give you all\n",
      "I owe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember, then, what you have promised, for I am Don Quixote de la Mancha, the righter of\n",
      "wrongs, and it is at your peril to disobey me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Don Quixote clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped off through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countryman watched till the Knight was out of sight. Then, turning, he said \"Come, my lad,\n",
      "and I'll pay thee what I owe, and more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay,\" answered the boy, \"see that you do, for if you do not, that brave man will come back\n",
      "and make you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare swear that,\" said the man. \"And just to show how much I love you, I am going to increase\n",
      "the debt, so that I may pay you more. Come here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that he caught the boy by the arm, tied him again to the tree, and belted him till\n",
      "his arm was tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now go,\" he said, \"and tell your righter of wrongs. I wish I had flayed you alive, you young\n",
      "whelp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so ended Don Quixote's first attempt to right wrongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Knight cantered along, very well pleased with himself, about two miles from where he\n",
      "had freed the boy he saw riding towards him six men, each shading himself under a large umbrella.\n",
      "With them were four mounted servants, and three on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did Don Quixote see this party than it struck him that here was the chance for which,\n",
      "above all others, he had been longing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Posting himself in the middle of the road, he waited till the men were at no great distance.\n",
      "Then, \"Halt!\" shouted he. \"Let all know that no man shall pass further till he owns that in\n",
      "the whole world there is no damsel more beautiful than the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said the men (who were merchants of Toledo, on their way to buy silks), \"we do not know\n",
      "the lady. We have never seen her. How then can we say that she is beautiful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" roared Don Quixote in a terrible rage, \"not know the beauteous Lady Dulcinea del Toboso!\n",
      "That only makes matters worse. Do you dare to argue?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that he couched his spear, drove his spurs into \"Rozinante,\" and rode furiously at\n",
      "the nearest merchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "What he would have done it is not possible to say. But as he galloped, it chanced that \"Rozinante\"\n",
      "stumbled and fell heavily, rolling Don Quixote over and over. There the Knight lay helpless,\n",
      "the weight of his armor preventing him from rising to his feet. But as he lay, he continued\n",
      "to cry out at the top of his voice, \"Stop, you rascals! Do not fly. It is my horse's fault\n",
      "that I lie here, you cowards!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the grooms, hearing his master called a rascal and a coward, thereupon ran up and snatched\n",
      "away Don Quixote's spear, which he broke in pieces. Then with each piece he belabored the poor\n",
      "Knight till the broken lance flew into splinters. The merchants then rode away, leaving Don\n",
      "Quixote lying where he fell, still shouting threats, but quite unable to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he was found by a man who knew him well, and who with great difficulty mounted him on\n",
      "his donkey and took him home. When at last they reached Don Quixote's house, the poor Knight\n",
      "was put to bed, where he lay for many days, raving, and very ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time the Curate of the village and the Barber came and burned nearly all the books\n",
      "which Don Quixote had so loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For,\" said they, \"it is by reading these books that the poor gentleman has lost his mind,\n",
      "and if he reads them again he will never get better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So a bonfire was made of the books, and the door of Don Quixote's study was bricked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Knight was again able to go about, he made at once for his study and his beloved books.\n",
      "Up and down the house he searched without saying a word, and often he would stand where the\n",
      "door of the study used to be, feeling with his hands and gazing about. At last he asked his\n",
      "housekeeper to show him the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Study!\" cried the woman, \"what study? There is no study in this house now, nor any books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said his niece. \"When you were away, a famous enchanter came along, mounted on a dragon,\n",
      "and he went into your study. What he did there we know not. But after a time he flew out of\n",
      "the roof, leaving the house full of smoke, and ever since then we have not been able to find\n",
      "either books or study.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha!\" said Don Quixote. \"That must have been Freston. He is a famous enchanter, and my bitter\n",
      "enemy. But when I am again well I shall get the better of him.\" But he had not forgotten the\n",
      "things for which he had come back to his village.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a farm laborer who lived near by, a fat, good-natured, simple man. To him Don Quixote\n",
      "talked long and often, and made many promises; among others that if he would but come with\n",
      "him as squire, he should be made governor of any island which the Knight might happen to conquer\n",
      "during his search after adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed so grand a thing to the man (whose name was Sancho Panza), that he willingly promised\n",
      "to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having got together some money, and having made other preparations, Don Quixote and Sancho\n",
      "Panza one dark night stole out of the village without a word to any one, and began their adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote rode \"Rozinante;\" Sancho Panza was mounted on an ass. That his squire should ride\n",
      "an ass at first troubled the Knight not a little, for in none of his books could he remember\n",
      "to have read of any squire being so mounted. However, he gave Sancho leave to bring the ass,\n",
      "thinking that in no great time a better mount would surely be found for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they rode along in the cool of the morning, Sancho Panza spoke to his master about their\n",
      "journey, and asked him to be sure not to forget his promise about the governorship of the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may even happen,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I may by some strange chance conquer a kingdom.\n",
      "And then presently, I may be able to crown thee King.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Sancho, \"if by some such miracle as your worship speaks of, I am made a King, then\n",
      "would my wife be Queen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" answered Don Quixote, \"who can doubt it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho, \"for I think if it should rain kingdoms upon the face of the\n",
      "earth, not one of them would sit well on my wife's head. For I must tell you, sir, she's not\n",
      "worth two brass jacks to make a Queen of. No, no! countess will be quite good enough; that's\n",
      "as much as she could well manage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" said Don Quixote, \"leave the matter in the hands of Providence, and be not tempted by\n",
      "anything less than the title of Viceroy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus talking, they came over the brow of a hill, and looking down on the plain below, Don Quixote\n",
      "saw there thirty or forty windmills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha!\" cried he. \"Fortune directs our affairs better than we ourselves could do. Look yonder,\n",
      "friend Sancho, there are at at least thirty outrageous giants whom I must now fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Giants!\" gasped Sancho Panza, \"what giants?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those whom you see over there with their long arms,\" answered Don Quixote. \"Some of that horrible\n",
      "race, I have heard, have arms near two leagues in length.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, sir,\" said Sancho, \"these are no giants. They are only windmills, and the things you\n",
      "think are arms are but their sails, whereby the wind drives them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is but a sign,\" answered Don Quixote, \"whereby one may see how little you know of adventures.\n",
      "I tell you they are giants: and I shall fight against them all. If you are afraid, go aside\n",
      "and say your prayers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, and without paying any heed to the bawlings of Sancho Panza, he put spurs to his\n",
      "horse and galloped furiously at the windmills, shouting aloud, \"Stand, cowards! stand your\n",
      "ground, and fly not from a single Knight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment the wind happened to rise, causing the arms of the windmills to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Base scoundrels!\" roared the Knight, \"though you wave as many arms as the giant Briareus,\n",
      "you shall pay for your pride.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with couched lance, and covering himself with his shield, he rushed \"Rozinante\" at top\n",
      "speed on the nearest windmill. Round whirled the sails, and as Don Quixote's lance pierced\n",
      "one of them, horse and man were sent rolling on the ground. There Sancho Panza came to help\n",
      "his sorely bruised master.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy o' me!\" cried Sancho, \"did not I tell you they were windmills?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peace, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote. \"It is the fortune of war. I know very well it\n",
      "is that accursed wizard Freston, the enemy who took from me my study and my books, who has\n",
      "changed these giants into windmills to take from me the honor of the victory. But in the end\n",
      "I shall yet surely get the better of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amen! say I\" quoth Sancho: and heaving the poor Knight on to his legs, once more he got him\n",
      "seated on \"Rozinante.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they now rode along, it was a great sorrow to Don Quixote that his spear had been broken\n",
      "to pieces in this battle with the windmill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have read,\" said he to Sancho, \"that a certain Spanish knight, having broken his sword in\n",
      "a fight, pulled up by the roots a huge oak-tree, or at least tore down a great branch, and\n",
      "with it did such wonderful deeds that he was ever after called 'The Bruiser.' I tell you this\n",
      "because I intend to tear up the next oak-tree we meet, and you may think yourself fortunate\n",
      "that you will see the deeds I shall perform with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven grant you may!\" said Sancho. \"But, an' it please you, sit a little more upright in\n",
      "your saddle; you are all to one side. But that, mayhap, comes from your hurts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no more to say,\" replied Sancho. \"Yet Heaven knows I should be glad to hear your honor\n",
      "complain a bit, now and then, when something ails you. For my part, I always cry out when I'm\n",
      "hurt, and I am glad the rule about not complaining doesn't extend to squires.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they spent under the trees, from one of which Don Quixote tore down a branch, to\n",
      "which he fixed the point of his spear, and in some sort that served him for a lance. Don Quixote\n",
      "neither ate nor slept all the night, but passed his time, as he had learned from his books\n",
      "that a knight should do, in thoughts of the Lady Dulcinea. As for Sancho Panza, he had brought\n",
      "with him a big bottle of wine, and some food in his wallet, and he stuffed himself as full\n",
      "as he could hold, and slept like a top.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they rode along next day, they came to the Pass of Lapice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"is the spot where adventures should begin. Now may we hope\n",
      "to thrust our hands, as it were, up to the very elbows in adventures. But remember this! However\n",
      "sore pressed and in danger I may be when fighting with another knight, you must not offer to\n",
      "draw your sword to help me. It is against the laws of chivalry for a squire to attack a knight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never fear me, master,\" said Sancho. \"I'll be sure to obey you; I have ever loved peace. But\n",
      "if a knight offers to set upon me first, there is no rule forbidding me to hit him back, is there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None,\" answered Don Quixote, \"only do not help me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not,\" said Sancho. \"Never trust me if I don't keep that commandment as well as I do\n",
      "the Sabbath.\" In the very first, wherein he fought with a man from Biscay, whom he left lying\n",
      "in a pool of blood, Don Quixote lost part of his helmet, and had the half of one of his ears\n",
      "sliced off by the Biscayan's sword. The accident to the helmet was a great grief to him, and\n",
      "he swore an oath that until he had taken from some other knight as good a helmet as that which\n",
      "was now made useless to him, he would never again eat his food on a table-cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day as they rode along a highway between two villages Don Quixote halted and looked eagerly\n",
      "at something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sancho,\" said he, \"dost thou not see yonder knight that comes riding this way on a dapple-gray\n",
      "steed, with a helmet of gold on his head?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a thing can I see,\" answered Sancho, \"but a fellow on just such another ass as mine, with\n",
      "something that glitters on top of his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you not see,\" asked Don Quixote, \"that it is a helmet? Do you stand back, and let me deal\n",
      "with him. Soon now shall I possess myself of the helmet that I need.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in those far-away days, when doctors were few, if anybody needed to be bled for a fever\n",
      "or any other illness (for it was then thought that \"letting blood\" was the cure for most illnesses),\n",
      "it was the custom for the barber to bleed the sick person. For the purpose of catching the\n",
      "blood that ran from a vein when it had been cut, a brass dish was carried, a dish with part\n",
      "of it cut away from one side, so that it might the more easily be held close to the patient's\n",
      "arm or body. A small dish like this you may sometimes still see hanging as a sign at the end\n",
      "of a pole outside barbers' shops. Barbers in those days of old were called barber-surgeons,\n",
      "for the reason that they bled people, as well as shaved them or cut their hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the truth of the matter was this, that the man whom Don Quixote now believed to be a knight,\n",
      "wearing a golden helmet, was a barber riding on his ass to bleed a sick man. And because it\n",
      "was raining, he had put his brass dish on his head, in order to keep his new hat from being\n",
      "spoiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote did not wait to speak to the man, but, couching his lance, galloped at him as hard\n",
      "as \"Rozinante\" could go, shouting as he rode, \"Defend thyself, base wretch!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The barber no sooner saw this terrible figure charging down on him, than, to save himself from\n",
      "being run through, he flung himself on to the ground, and then jumping to his feet, ran for\n",
      "his life, leaving his ass and the brass basin behind him. Then Don Quixote ordered Sancho to\n",
      "pick up the helmet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O' my word,\" said Sancho, as he gave it to his master, \"it is a fine basin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote at once put it on his head, saying, \"It is a famous helmet, but the head for which\n",
      "it was made must have been of great size. The worst of it is that at least one-half of it is\n",
      "gone. What is the fool grinning at now?\" he cried, as Sancho laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, master,\" answered Sancho, \"it is a barber's basin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has indeed some likeness to a basin,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I tell you it is an enchanted\n",
      "helmet of pure gold, and for the sake of a little wretched money some one has melted down the\n",
      "half of it. When we come to a town where there is an armorer, I will have it altered to fit\n",
      "my head. Meantime I shall wear it as it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they rode along one day talking of many things, Don Quixote beheld a cloud of dust rising\n",
      "right before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seest thou that cloud of dust, Sancho?\" he asked. \"It is raised by a great army marching this\n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, master,\" said Sancho, \"there must be two armies there, for yonder is just such another\n",
      "cloud of dust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The knight looked, and was overjoyed, believing that two armies were about to meet and fight\n",
      "in the plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are we to do, master?\" asked Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do!\" said Don Quixote, \"why, what can we do but help the weaker side? Look yonder, Sancho,\n",
      "that knight whom thou seest in the gilded armory with a lion crouching at the feet of a lady\n",
      "painted on his shield, that is the valiant Laurcalco. That other, the giant on his right, Brandabarbaran.\"\n",
      "And he ran over a long list of names of knights whom he believed that he saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho listened, as dumb as a fish; but at last he gasped. \"Why, master, you might as well\n",
      "tell me that it snows. Never a knight, nor a giant, nor a man can I see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How!\" answered Don Quixote, \"canst thou not hear their horses neigh, and their drums beating?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drums!\" said Sancho. \"Not I! I hear only the bleating of sheep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since you are afraid,\" said the Knight, \"stand aside, and I will go by myself to fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he galloped down on to the plain, shouting, leaving Sancho bawling to him, \"Hold,\n",
      "sir! Stop! For Heaven's sake come back. As sure as I'm a sinner, they are only harmless sheep.\n",
      "Come back, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Don Quixote, paying not the least heed, galloped on furiously and charged into the middle\n",
      "of the sheep, spearing them right and left, trampling the living and the dead under \"Rozinante's\"\n",
      "feet. The shepherds, finding that he took no notice of their shouts, now hurled stones at him\n",
      "from their slings, and one big stone presently hit the Knight fair in his ribs and doubled\n",
      "him up in the saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gasping for breath, with all speed Don Quixote got from his wallet a bottle filled with a mixture\n",
      "he had made, a mixture which he firmly believed to be a certain cure for all wounds. Of this\n",
      "he took a long gulp, but just at that moment another big stone hit him such a rap on the mouth\n",
      "that the bottle was smashed into a thousand pieces, and half of his teeth were knocked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down dropped the Knight on the ground, and the shepherds thinking that he was killed, ran away,\n",
      "taking with them seven dead sheep which he had slain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza found his master in a very bad way, with nearly all the teeth gone from one side\n",
      "of his mouth, and with a terrible pain under his ribs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! master,\" he said, \"I told you they were sheep. Why would not you listen to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sheep! Sancho. No, no! There is nothing so easy for a wizard like Freston as to change things\n",
      "from one shape to the other. I will wager if you now mount your ass and ride over the hill\n",
      "after them, you will find no sheep there, but the knights and squires come back to their own\n",
      "shape, and the armies marching as when we first saw them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, after this and many other adventures (about which, perhaps, you may some day read for\n",
      "yourself), Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rode away into the mountains, for the Knight was sorely\n",
      "in need of a quiet place in which to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So weary were he and his squire, that one night, when they had ridden into a wood, and it chanced\n",
      "that the horse and the ass stood still, both Don Quixote and Sancho Panza fell sound asleep\n",
      "without even getting out of their saddles. There sat the Knight, leaning on his lance; and\n",
      "Sancho, doubled over the pommel, snored as loud as if he had been in a four-post feather bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that a wandering thief saw them as he passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" thought he, \"I want something to ride upon, for I'm tired of walking in these abominable\n",
      "mountains. Here's a chance of a good ass. But how am I to get it, without waking its master?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Very quietly he cut four long sticks. One after the other he placed these under each side of\n",
      "Sancho's saddle; then loosening the girths, he gradually raised the sticks till the saddle\n",
      "was clear of the animal's back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gently, in the moonlight, he led the tired ass away, and Sancho, undisturbed, snored on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was broad daylight, the squire awoke, and without opening his eyes, stretched himself.\n",
      "Down fell the sticks; down with a terrible bump fell Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Body o' me!\" he yelled, \"where is my ass?\" And with many tears he searched high and low, but\n",
      "no ass was then to be found, nor for many months afterwards. And how at last Sancho got back\n",
      "the ass you must read for yourself in the History of Don Quixote. For yourself, too, you must\n",
      "read of Don Quixote's adventures in the mountains; how he there did penance; and of many other\n",
      "things, till at last the Curate and the Barber of La Mancha took him home in a cart which the\n",
      "Knight believed to be an enchanted chariot.\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW DON QUIXOTE SAW DULCINEA\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a third time did Don Quixote set off on his search for adventures, and as he and Sancho\n",
      "Panza rode again away from their village, it seemed to Don Quixote that certainly it was his\n",
      "duty as a knight-errant to visit the Mistress of his Heart, the beautiful Dulcinea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was midnight when they reached Toboso, and the whole town was still, everybody in bed and\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lead me to her palace, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Palace?\" cried Sancho, \"What palace do you mean? Body o' me! When last I saw her, she lived\n",
      "in a little cottage in a blind alley. And even if it were a palace, we can't go and thunder\n",
      "at the door at this time o' night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we find it, I will tell thee what to do. But, here! What is this?\" said the Knight, riding\n",
      "up to a huge building, and knocking at the door. \"This indeed, without doubt, must be her palace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was only the great Church of Toboso. Hunt as he would, he found no Dulcinea's palace,\n",
      "and as morning began to break, Sancho persuaded him to come and rest in a grove of trees two\n",
      "miles outside the town. From there Sancho was again sent to look for Dulcinea, bearing many\n",
      "messages from his sorrowful master.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cheer up, sir,\" said Sancho. \"I'll be back in a trice. Don't be cast down. Faint heart never\n",
      "won fair lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Sancho rode away, leaving the Knight sitting on his horse, very full of melancholy. But\n",
      "he had not ridden far, when, turning round and finding that his master was no longer in sight,\n",
      "the squire dismounted, and lying down under a shady tree, began to think the matter over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friend Sancho,\" said he to himself, \"what's this you are doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, hunting for a Princess, who, my master says, is the Sun of Beauty, and all sorts of other\n",
      "fine things, and who lives in a King's palace, or great castle, somewhere or other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how are you going to find her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, to look for Dulcinea all over Toboso.\n",
      "My master's mad, there's no doubt of that; and perhaps I'm not very much better, for they say\n",
      "birds of a feather flock together. But if he's so mad as to mistake windmills for giants, and\n",
      "flocks of sheep for armies, why, it shouldn't be so very hard to make him believe that the\n",
      "first country lass I meet is the Lady Dulcinea. If he won't believe, I'll swear it, and stand\n",
      "to it, so that he'll think some of those wicked wizards of his have played another trick on\n",
      "him, and have changed her into some other shape just to spite him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus settled his plans, Sancho lay there till the evening, so that his master might\n",
      "think that all the day had been spent in going to and from Toboso, and in looking for Dulcinea.\n",
      "\n",
      "As luck would have it, just as he mounted his ass to ride back to Don Quixote, he spied coming\n",
      "that way three country lasses mounted on asses. As soon as Sancho saw the girls, he made haste\n",
      "to get to his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What news, Sancho?\" asked the Knight. \"Has your fortune been good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, marry has it, sir,\" answered Sancho, \"you have no more to do but to clap spurs to 'Rozinante'\n",
      "and get into the open fields, and you'll meet my Lady Dulcinea del Toboso with two of her damsels\n",
      "coming to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blessed Heaven!\" cried the Knight. \"What do you say, my dear Sancho? Is it possible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possible!\" said Sancho. \"Why should I play a trick on you? Come, sir, and you will see her\n",
      "presently, all dressed up and decked with jewels. Her damsels and she are all covered with\n",
      "diamonds, and rubies, and cloth of gold. And what is more, they are riding three flea-bitten\n",
      "gambling hags, the like of which won't be seen again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ambling nags, thou meanest, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, master, gambling hags or ambling nags, it's all one and the same thing. Any way,\n",
      "I'm sure I never set eyes on more beautiful ladies than those that sit upon them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us be moving then, Sancho. And as a reward for your good news, I promise you the very\n",
      "best things I get in our next adventure. And if that is not enough, then I will give you the\n",
      "three colts that I have at home in La Mancha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you for the colts,\" said Sancho. \"As for the other things, I'm not sure that they will\n",
      "be worth so very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now out of the wood, and could see the three country lasses at a little distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote looked long towards Toboso, but seeing no one anywhere but these girls, he was\n",
      "much troubled in his mind, and asked Sancho if he were sure that the Princess had left the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Left the city!\" cried Sancho. \"Why where are your eyes, sir? In the name of wonder, do you\n",
      "not see her and her maidens coming towards us now, as bright as the sun at midday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see nothing, Sancho, but three country wenches riding on asses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now Heaven help me,\" cried Sancho, \"is it possible that you can mistake three what do you\n",
      "call 'ems--ambling nags as white as snow, for three asses! Pull my beard out by the roots if\n",
      "it is not so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Believe me, Sancho, they are asses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, sir,\" answered Sancho, \"do but clear your eyes, and go and speak to the Mistress of\n",
      "your Heart, for she is near you now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Sancho hurried up to one of the girls, and, jumping off his ass, fell on his knees\n",
      "before her, gabbling a lot of nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote followed, and also knelt down, gazing with doubting and sorrowful eyes on the creature\n",
      "that Sancho had told him was the beautiful Dulcinea. He was lost in wonder, for she was a flat-nosed,\n",
      "blubber-cheeked, bouncing country girl, and Don Quixote could not utter a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come! get out of the way,\" screamed the girl, \"and let us go about our business. We're in\n",
      "a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote when he heard the girl's voice. \"I am now convinced that misfortune\n",
      "has not yet finished with me. O most beautiful lady! a spiteful enchanter puts mists before\n",
      "my eyes, and hides from me your loveliness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My grandmother take him!\" cried the girl. \"Listen to his gibberish! Get out of the way, and\n",
      "let us alone.\" And kicking her donkey in the ribs, she galloped away with her friends. Don\n",
      "Quixote followed them long with his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O the spite of those wicked enchanters!\" he sighed, \"to turn my beautiful Dulcinea into so\n",
      "vile a shape as that: to take from her the sweet and delicate scent of fragrant flowers, and\n",
      "give to her what she has. For, to tell the truth, Sancho, she gave me such a whiff of raw onions\n",
      "that it was like to upset me altogether.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O the vile and evil-minded enchanters!\" cried Sancho. \"Oh that I might see the lot of you\n",
      "threaded on one string, and hung up in the smoke like so many herrings.\" And Sancho turned\n",
      "away to hide his laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote rode on, very sad, and letting \"Rozinante\" go where he pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "VI\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW DON QUIXOTE FOUGHT WITH A LION; AND HOW HE DEFEATED THE MOORS\n",
      "\n",
      "As Don Quixote and Sancho Panza went along, they were overtaken by a gentleman in a fine green\n",
      "coat, who rode a very good mare. This gentleman stared very hard at Don Quixote, and the two\n",
      "began to speak together about knight-errantry, and were so interested in what they were saying,\n",
      "that Sancho took the opportunity of riding over to ask for a little milk from some shepherds,\n",
      "who were milking their ewes near at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was thus away from his master, a wagon, on top of which fluttered little yellow and\n",
      "red flags, came along the road towards them. Don Quixote at once imagined this to be some new\n",
      "adventure, and he called to Sancho for his helmet. At the moment, Sancho was bargaining with\n",
      "the shepherds for some curds. Hearing his master call, he had not time to wait till the shepherds\n",
      "could give him a bowl in which to carry them, and not wishing to lose his bargain (for he had\n",
      "paid the shepherds), he poured the curds into the Knight's helmet, and galloped off to see\n",
      "what his master wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me my helmet,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if I know anything of my business, here is an adventure\n",
      "for which I must be ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman in green, hearing what Don Quixote said, looked everywhere, but he could see\n",
      "nothing except the wagon coming towards them, and as that had on it the King of Spain's colors,\n",
      "he thought that no doubt it was one of his Majesty's treasure-vans. He said as much to Don\n",
      "Quixote, but the Knight answered: \"Sir, I cannot tell when, or where, or in what shape, my\n",
      "enemies will attack me. It is always wise to be ready. Fore-warned is fore-armed. Give me my\n",
      "helmet, Sancho!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snatching it out of Sancho's unwilling hands, he clapped it on his head without looking into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this, Sancho?\" he cried, as the whey ran down his face. \"What is the matter with me?\n",
      "Is my brain melting, or am I breaking out in a cold sweat? If I am, it is not from fear. This\n",
      "must be a dreadful adventure that is coming. Quick. Sancho! give me something to wipe away\n",
      "the torrent of sweat, for I am almost blinded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a word, Sancho handed to his master a cloth. Don Quixote dried himself, and then took\n",
      "off his helmet to see what it was that felt so cold on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this white stuff?\" said he, putting some of the curds to his nose. \"Sancho, you vile\n",
      "traitor, you have been putting curds in my helmet!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curds!--I?\" cried Sancho. \"Nay, the devil must have put them there. Would I dare to make such\n",
      "a mess in your helmet, sir? It must have been one of those vile enchanters. Where could I get\n",
      "curds? I would sooner put them in my stomach than in your helmet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's true, I dare say,\" said Don Quixote. \"There's something in that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again he put on the helmet, and made ready for the adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now come what may, I dare meet it,\" he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wagon had now come near to them. On top was seated a man, and the driver rode one of the\n",
      "mules that drew it. Don Quixote rode up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whither go ye, my friends?\" said he. \"What wagon is this, and what have you in it? What is\n",
      "the meaning of the flags?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The wagon is mine,\" said the driver, \"and I have in it a lion that is being sent to the King,\n",
      "and the flags are flying to let the people know that it is the King's property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A lion!\" cried Don Quixote, \"Is it a large one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The biggest I ever saw,\" said the man on top of the wagon. \"I am the keeper, and I have had\n",
      "charge of many lions, but I never saw one so large as this. Pray get out of the way, sir, for\n",
      "we must hurry on to our stopping-place. It is already past his feeding-time; he is beginning\n",
      "to get hungry, and they are always savage when they are hungry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried Don Quixote, \"lion whelps against me! I'll let those gentlemen know who send\n",
      "lions this way, that I am not to be scared by any of their lions. So, Mr. Keeper, just jump\n",
      "down and open his cage, and let him out. In spite of all the enchanters in the world that have\n",
      "sent him to try me, I'll let the animal see who Don Quixote de la Mancha is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Up ran Sancho to the gentleman in green.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O good, dear sir,\" he cried, \"don't let my master get at the lion, or we shall all be torn\n",
      "to pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said the gentleman, \"is your master so mad that you fear he'll set upon such a dangerous\n",
      "brute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, sir, he's not mad; he's only rash, very, very rash,\" cried Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the gentleman, \"I'll see to it,\" and up he went to Don Quixote, who was trying\n",
      "to get the keeper to open the cage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said he, \"knight-errants ought not to engage in adventures from which there is no hope\n",
      "of coming off in safety. That is more like madness than courage. Besides, this is the King's\n",
      "wagon; it will never do to stop that. And after all, the lion has not been sent against you;\n",
      "it is a present to the King.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, sir,\" cried Don Quixote, \"will you attend to your own business? This is mine, and I\n",
      "know best whether this lion has been sent against me or not. Now you, sir,\" he cried to the\n",
      "keeper, \"either open that cage at once, or I'll pin you to your wagon with my spear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For mercy's sake, sir,\" cried the driver, \"do but let me take my mules out of harm's way before\n",
      "the lion gets out. My cart and my mules are all I have in the world, and I shall be ruined\n",
      "if harm comes to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take them out quickly, then,\" said Don Quixote, \"and take them where you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the driver made all the haste he could to unharness his mules, while the keeper called\n",
      "aloud, \"Take notice, everybody, that it is against my will that I am forced to let loose the\n",
      "lion, and that this gentleman here is to blame for all the damage that will be done. Get out\n",
      "of the way, everybody: look out for yourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more the gentleman in green tried to persuade Don Quixote not to be so foolish, but the\n",
      "Knight only said, \"I know very well what I am doing. If you are afraid, and do not care to\n",
      "see the fight, just put spurs to your mare and take yourself where you think you will be safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho now hurried up, and with tears in his eyes begged his master not to put himself in so\n",
      "great danger, but Don Quixote only said, \"Take yourself away, Sancho, and leave me alone. If\n",
      "I am killed, go, as I have so often told you, to the beautiful Dulcinea, and tell her--you\n",
      "know what to tell her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman in green, finding that words were thrown away on Don Quixote, now quickly followed\n",
      "the driver, who had hastily taken his mules as far away as he could beyond the brow of the\n",
      "hill. Sancho hurried after them at the top speed of his ass, kicking him in the ribs all the\n",
      "while to make him go even faster, and loudly bewailing his master's coming death. The keeper\n",
      "made one more attempt to turn Don Quixote from his folly, but again finding it useless, very\n",
      "unwillingly opened the cage door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime the Knight had been thinking whether it would be best to fight the lion on foot or\n",
      "on horseback, and he had made up his mind to fight on foot, for the reason that \"Rozinante\"\n",
      "would probably be too much afraid to face the lion. So he got off his horse, drew his sword,\n",
      "and holding his shield in front of him, marched slowly up to the cage. The keeper, having thrown\n",
      "the door wide open, now quickly got himself out of harm's way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lion, seeing the cage open, and Don Quixote standing in front, turned round and stretched\n",
      "out his great paws. Then he opened his enormous mouth, and, letting out a tongue as long as\n",
      "a man's arm, licked the dust off his face. Now rising to his feet, he thrust his head out of\n",
      "the door and glared around with eyes like burning coals.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sight to make any man afraid; but Don Quixote calmly waited for the animal to jump\n",
      "out and come within reach of his sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lion looked at him for a moment with its great yellow eyes--then, slowly turning, it strolled\n",
      "to the back of the cage, gave a long, weary yawn, and lay quietly down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Force him to come out,\" cried Don Quixote to the keeper, \"beat him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I,\" said the man. \"I dare not for my life. He would tear me to pieces. And let me advise\n",
      "you, sir, to be content with your day's work. I beseech you, go no further. You have shown\n",
      "how brave you are. No man can be expected to do more than challenge his enemy and wait ready\n",
      "for him. If he does not come, the fault and the disgrace are his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis true,\" said the Knight. \"Shut the door, my friend, and give me the best certificate you\n",
      "can of what you have seen me do; how you opened the door, and how I waited for the lion to\n",
      "come out, and how he turned tail and lay down. I am obliged to do no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Don Quixote put on the end of his spear the cloth with which he had wiped the curds\n",
      "from his face, and began to wave to the others to come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be hanged,\" cried Sancho when he saw this signal, \"if my master has not killed the lion.\"\n",
      "And they all hurried up to the wagon where the keeper gave them a long account of what had\n",
      "happened, adding, that when he got to court he would tell the King of Don Quixote's bravery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If his Majesty should happen to ask who did this thing, tell him,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\n",
      "it was the Knight of the Lions, for that is the name by which I shall now call myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho and his master now rode with the gentleman in green to his house, where they stopped\n",
      "some days, to the great contentment of Sancho. And of the wedding at which they were present,\n",
      "of the feast where Sancho so greatly enjoyed himself, as well as of other matters, you must\n",
      "read for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Knight and his squire again began their travels, it chanced that they stopped one\n",
      "night at an inn. To this inn, while Don Quixote was outside, waiting for supper, there came\n",
      "a man, all dressed in chamois leather, and wearing over his left eye, and part of his face,\n",
      "a green patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any lodgings, landlord?\" he cried in a loud voice; \"for here comes the fortune-telling\n",
      "ape, and the great puppet-show of Melisendra's Deliverance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, bless me!\" cried the innkeeper, \"if here isn't Master Peter. Now we shall have a merry\n",
      "night of it. You are welcome, with all my heart. Where is the ape, Peter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Coming presently,\" said Master Peter. \"I only came on before to see if lodgings were to be had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lodgings!\" cried the landlord. \"Why, I'd turn out the Duke of Alva himself rather than you\n",
      "should want room. Bring on the monkey and the show, for I have guests in the inn to-night who\n",
      "will pay well to see the performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's good news,\" said Peter, going off to hurry up his cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is this Peter?\" asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, sir,\" answered the landlord, \"he has been going about the country this long time with\n",
      "his play of Melisendra and Don Gayferos, one of the very best shows that ever was seen. Then\n",
      "he has the cleverest ape in the world. You have only to ask it a question and it will jump\n",
      "on its master's shoulder and whisper the answer in his ear, and then Master Peter will tell\n",
      "you what it says. It's true, he isn't always right, but he so often hits the nail on the head\n",
      "that we sometimes think Satan is in him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote no sooner saw the ape, than he marched up to it, and asked a question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Master Peter, \"the animal can't tell what is going to happen; only what has already\n",
      "happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't give a brass centesimo,\" cried Sancho, \"to know what is past. Who can tell that\n",
      "better than myself? Tell me what my wife Teresa is doing at home just now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Master Peter tapped his shoulder: the ape at once sprang on to it, and putting its head at\n",
      "his ear, began to chatter--as apes do--for a minute. Then it skipped down again, and immediately\n",
      "Master Peter ran to Don Quixote and fell on his knees before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O glorious restorer of knight-errantry!\" he cried, \"who can say enough in praise of the great\n",
      "Don Quixote de la Mancha, the righter of wrongs, the comfort of the afflicted and unhappy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was amazed at these words, for he was certain that he was unknown to any one at\n",
      "the inn. He did not guess that Master Peter was a clever rogue, who, before giving a performance,\n",
      "always made it his business to find out about those who were likely to be looking on.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Sancho, he quaked with fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thou, honest Sancho,\" went on Master Peter, \"the best squire to the best knight in the\n",
      "world, be not unhappy about your wife. She is well, and at this moment is dressing flax. By\n",
      "the same token, she has at her left hand, to cheer her, a broken-mouthed jug of wine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's like enough,\" said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" cried Don Quixote, \"if I had not seen it with my own eyes, nothing should have made\n",
      "me believe that apes have the gift of second sight. I am in very truth the Don Quixote de la\n",
      "Mancha that this wonderful animal has told you about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was not quite pleased at the idea of the ape having such powers, and taking Sancho aside\n",
      "he spoke to him seriously on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they spoke, the showman came to tell them that the puppet-show was now ready to begin,\n",
      "and Don Quixote and Sancho went into the room where it stood, with candles burning all round\n",
      "it. Master Peter got inside in order to move the puppets, and a boy standing in front explained\n",
      "what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story that was acted by the puppets was that of a certain Don Gayferos, who rescued his\n",
      "wife Melisendra from captivity by the Moors in the city of Saragossa. Melisendra was imprisoned\n",
      "in the castle, and the story goes that Don Gayferos, when riding past, in his search, spied\n",
      "her on the balcony. Melisendra, with the help of a rope, lets herself down to her husband,\n",
      "mounts behind him, and the two gallop away from the city. But Melisendra's flight has been\n",
      "noticed, and the city bells ring an alarm. The Moors rush out like angry wasps, start in pursuit,\n",
      "and the capture and death of Don Gayferos and Melisendra seem certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote listened and looked with growing excitement and anger, but when he saw the Moors\n",
      "gallop in pursuit and about to close on Don Gayferos and Melisendra, he could keep quiet no\n",
      "longer. Starting up, \"It shall never be said,\" cried he, \"that in my presence I suffered such\n",
      "a wrong to be done to so famous a knight as Don Gayferos. Stop your unjust pursuit, ye base\n",
      "rascals! Stop! or prepare to meet me in battle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, drawing his sword, with one spring he fell with fury on the Moors, hacking some in pieces,\n",
      "beheading others, and sending the rest flying into every corner. And had not Master Peter ducked\n",
      "and squatted down on the ground behind part of the show, Don Quixote would certainly have chopped\n",
      "off his head also.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold! hold, sir!\" cried Master Peter, \"for mercy's sake, hold! These are not real Moors. You\n",
      "will ruin me if you destroy my show.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Don Quixote paid not the slightest heed. He went on slashing and hacking till the whole\n",
      "show was a wreck. Everybody ran to get out of harm's way, and the ape scampered, chattering,\n",
      "on to the roof of the house. Sancho himself quaked with fear, for he had never before seen\n",
      "his master in such a fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the puppet Moors being now cut to pieces, Don Quixote became calmer, saying aloud, \"How\n",
      "miserable had been the fate of poor Don Gayferos and Melisendra his wife if I had not been\n",
      "in time to save them from those infidel Moors! Long live knight-errantry!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, ay,\" moaned Master Peter in a doleful voice, \"it may live long enough. As for me, I may\n",
      "as well die, for I am a ruined man and a beggar now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza took pity on the showman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come! Master Peter,\" said he, \"don't cry. Don't be cast down. My master will pay you\n",
      "when he comes to know that he has done you an injury.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly,\" said Peter, \"if his honor will pay for my puppets.'ll ask no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How!\" cried Don Quixote. \"I do not see that I have injured you, good Master Peter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not injured me!\" cried Master Peter. \"Do but look at those figures lying there, all hacked\n",
      "to bits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Don Quixote, \"now I know for certain a truth I have suspected before, that those\n",
      "accursed enchanters do nothing but put before my eyes things as they are, and then presently\n",
      "after change them as they please. Really and truly gentlemen, I vow and protest that all that\n",
      "was acted here seemed to me to be real. I could not contain my fury, and I acted as I thought\n",
      "was my duty. But if Master Peter will tell me the value of the figures, I will pay for them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven bless your worship!\" whined Master Peter. But had Don Quixote known that this same\n",
      "Master Peter was the very man who stole Sancho Panza's ass, perhaps he might have paid him\n",
      "in another way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had ridden no great way when they happened upon some young people who had gaily dressed\n",
      "themselves as shepherds and shepherdesses, and were having a picnic in the woods. These people\n",
      "invited Don Quixote and Sancho to join their feast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had eaten and drunk, the Knight rose, and said that there was no sin worse than that\n",
      "of ingratitude, and that to show how grateful he was for the kindness that had been shown to\n",
      "him and to Sancho, he had only one means in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore,\" said he, \"I will maintain for two whole days, in the middle of this high road\n",
      "leading to Saragossa, that these ladies here, disguised as shepherdesses, are the most beautiful\n",
      "damsels in the world, except only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the mistress of my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, mounting \"Rozinante\" he rode into the middle of the highway and there took his stand, ready\n",
      "to challenge all comers. He had sat there no long time when there appeared on the road coming\n",
      "towards him a number of riders, some with spears in their hands, all riding very fast and close\n",
      "together. In front of them thundered a drove of wild bulls, bellowing and tossing their horns.\n",
      "At once all the shepherds and the shepherdesses ran behind trees, but Don Quixote sat bravely\n",
      "where he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the horsemen came near, \"Get out of the way!\" bawled one of them. \"Stand clear, or these\n",
      "bulls will have you in pieces in no time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Halt, scoundrels!\" roared the Knight. \"What are bulls to Don Quixote de la Mancha, if they\n",
      "were the fiercest that ever lived? Stop, hangdogs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the herdsmen had no time to answer, nor Don Quixote to get out of the way had he wanted\n",
      "to do so, for before any one knew what was happening, the bulls had run right over him and\n",
      "\"Rozinante,\" leaving them and Sancho and \"Dapple,\" his ass, stunned and bruised, rolling in\n",
      "the dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Don Quixote came to his senses he got up in great haste, stumbling here and falling\n",
      "there, and began to run after the herd.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop, you scoundrels!\" he bawled. \"Stop! It is a single knight that defies you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But no one took the least notice of him, and he sat sadly down on the road, waiting till Sancho\n",
      "brought \"Rozinante\" to him. Then master and man went on their way, Don Quixote sore ashamed\n",
      "of his defeat, hurt as much in mind as in body.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening they dismounted at the door of an inn, and put up \"Rozinante\" and \"Dapple\" in\n",
      "the stable. Sancho asked the landlord what he could give them for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said the man, \"you may have anything you choose to call for. The inn can provide fowls\n",
      "of the air, birds of the earth, and fishes of the sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no need for all that,\" said Sancho. \"If you roast a couple of chickens it will be\n",
      "enough, for my master eats but little, and for myself, I have no great appetite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chickens?\" said the host. \"I am sorry I have no chickens just now. The hawks have killed them\n",
      "all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, roast us a pullet, if it be tender.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pullet? Well, now, that is unlucky. I sent away fifty to the market only yesterday. But,\n",
      "putting pullets aside, ask for anything you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, then,\" said Sancho, pondering, \"let us have some veal, or a bit of kid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry sir, we are just out of veal and kid also. Next week we shall have enough and to spare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That helps us nicely,\" said Sancho. \"But at any rate, let us have some eggs and bacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eggs!\" cried the landlord. \"Now didn't I tell him I had no hens or pullets, and how then can\n",
      "I have eggs? No, no! Ask for anything you please in the way of dainties, but don't ask for hens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Body o' me!\" said Sancho, \"let us have something. Tell me what you have, and have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what I really and truly have is a pair of cow-heels that look like calves'-feet, or\n",
      "a pair of calves'-feet that look like cow-heels. You can have that and some bacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are mine,\" cried Sancho. \"I don't care whether they are feet or heels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as Don Quixote had supper with some other guests who carried with them their own cook and\n",
      "their own larder, Sancho and the landlord supped well on the cow-heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days after this, the Knight and his squire reached Barcelona. Neither of them had ever\n",
      "before been near the sea, and the galleys that they saw in the distance being rowed about in\n",
      "the bay sorely puzzled Sancho, who thought that the oars were their legs, and that they must\n",
      "be some strange kind of beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, one morning, when Don Quixote rode out, fully armed as usual, to take the air on the seashore,\n",
      "he saw a knight riding towards him, armed like himself, and having a bright moon painted on\n",
      "his shield. As soon as this knight came within hearing he halted, and in a loud voice called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Illustrious Don Quixote de la Mancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, of whose doings you\n",
      "may have heard. I am come to fight with you and to make you own that the Lady of my Heart,\n",
      "whoever she may be, is more beautiful by far than the Lady Dulcinea del Toboso. Which truth,\n",
      "if you will confess, I will not slay you. And if we fight, and I should conquer you, then I\n",
      "ask no more than that you shall go to your own home, and for the space of one year give up\n",
      "carrying arms or searching for adventures. But if you should conquer me, then my head shall\n",
      "be at your disposal, my horse and arms shall be your spoils, and the fame of my deeds shall\n",
      "be yours. Consider what I say, and let your answer be quick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was amazed at hearing these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knight of the White Moon,\" said he very solemnly, \"the fame of whose doings has not yet come\n",
      "to my ears, I dare swear that thou hast never seen the beautiful Dulcinea, for hadst thou ever\n",
      "viewed her, thou wouldst have been careful not to make this challenge. The sight of her would\n",
      "have made thee know that there never has been, nor can be, beauty to match hers. And therefore,\n",
      "without giving thee the lie, I only tell thee thou art mistaken. I accept your challenge, on\n",
      "your conditions, and at once, except that I am content with the fame of my own deeds, and want\n",
      "not yours. Choose then whichever side of the field you please, and let us set to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two knights then turned their horses to take ground for their charge, but at this moment\n",
      "up rode, with some friends, the Governor of the city of Barcelona, who knew Don Quixote, and\n",
      "who fancied that perhaps this was some new trick being played on him. The Governor, seeing\n",
      "both knights ready to turn for their charge, asked the Knight of the White Moon what was the\n",
      "cause of the combat, and having heard his answer, could not believe that the affair was not\n",
      "a joke, and so stood aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the two knights charged at top speed. But the horse of the Knight of the White Moon\n",
      "was by far the bigger and heavier and faster, and he came with such a shock into poor old \"Rozinante\"\n",
      "that Don Quixote and his horse were hurled to the ground with terrible force, and lay stunned\n",
      "and helpless. In a moment the Knight of the White Moon was off his horse and holding his spear\n",
      "at Don Quixote's throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yield, Sir Knight!\" he cried, \"or you are a dead man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote, sorely hurt, but with steadfast look, gasped in a faint voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not yield. Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the whole world. Press\n",
      "on with your spear, Sir Knight, and kill me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" said the Knight of the White Moon. \"That will I not do. I am content if the great Don\n",
      "Quixote return to his home for a year, as we agreed before we fought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Don Quixote answered very faintly that as nothing was asked of him to the hurt of Dulcinea,\n",
      "he would carry out all the rest faithfully and truly. The Knight of the White Moon then galloped\n",
      "away toward the city, where one of the Governor's friends followed him, in order to find out\n",
      "who he was. The victorious knight was Samson Carrasco, who, some months before, had fought\n",
      "with and had been beaten by Don Quixote. And he explained to the Governor's friend that all\n",
      "he wanted in fighting was, not to harm Don Quixote, but to make him promise to go home, and\n",
      "stop there for a year, by which time he hoped that his madness about knight-errantry might\n",
      "be cured.\n",
      "\n",
      "They raised Don Quixote and took off his helmet. His face was very pale, and he was covered\n",
      "with a cold sweat. \"Rozinante\" was in as bad plight as his master, and lay where he had fallen.\n",
      "Sancho, in great grief, could speak no word, and knew not what to do; to him it was all as\n",
      "a bad dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was carried on a stretcher to the town, where for a week he lay in bed without\n",
      "ever raising his head, stricken to the soul by the disgrace of his defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho tried to comfort him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pluck up your heart and be of good cheer, sir,\" he cried, \"and thank Heaven you have broken\n",
      "no bones. They that give must take. Let us go home and give up looking for adventures.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"it is only for a year. After that I can begin again,\n",
      "and perhaps then I may be able to make thee an Earl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven grant it\" said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the Knight was once more able to move they set out for home, Don Quixote riding \"Rozinante\"\n",
      "Sancho walking, for \"Dapple\" carried the armor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all the way Don Quixote did not recover from his melancholy, and when at last they reached\n",
      "his village:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help me to bed,\" he said, \"for I think that I am not very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was put to bed, and carefully nursed. But a fever had taken hold of him, and for many days\n",
      "Sancho Panza never left his master's bedside. On the sixth day, the doctor told him he was\n",
      "in great danger. Don Quixote listened very calmly, and then asked that he might be left by\n",
      "himself for a little--he had a mind to sleep. His niece and Sancho left the room weeping bitterly,\n",
      "and Don Quixote fell into a deep sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke, with a firm voice he cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blessed be God! My mind is is now clear, and the clouds have rolled away which those detestable\n",
      "books of knight-errantry cast over me. Now can I see their nonsense and deceit. I am at the\n",
      "point of death, and I would meet it so that I may not leave behind me the character of a madman.\n",
      "Send for the lawyer, that I may make my will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Excepting only a small sum of money which he gave to Sancho Panza, he left all to his niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter he fell back in bed, and lay unconscious and without movement till the third day,\n",
      "when death very gently took him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So died Don Quixote de la Mancha, a good man and a brave gentleman to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "A voyage in those days was not often a pleasant thing, for ships then were very bluff-bowed\n",
      "and slow-sailing, and, for a long voyage, very ill-provided with food. There were no tinned\n",
      "meats two hundred years ago, no luxuries for use even in the cabin. Sailors lived chiefly on\n",
      "salt junk, as hard as leather, on biscuit that was generally as much weevil as biscuit, and\n",
      "the water that they drank was evil-smelling and bad when it had been long in the ship's casks.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when a man said good-by to his friends and sailed away into the unknown, generally very\n",
      "many years passed before he came back--if ever he came back at all. For the dangers of the\n",
      "seas were then far greater than they now are, and if a ship was not wrecked some dark night\n",
      "on an unknown island or uncharted reef, there was always the probability of meeting a pirate\n",
      "vessel and of having to fight for life and liberty. Steam has nowadays nearly done away with\n",
      "pirates, except on the China coast and in a few other out-of-the-way places. But things were\n",
      "different long ago, before steamers were invented; and sailors then, when they came home, had\n",
      "many very surprising things to tell their friends, many astonishing adventures to speak of,\n",
      "among the strange peoples that they said they had met in far-off lands. One man, who saw more\n",
      "wonderful things than any one else, was named Lemuel Gulliver, and I will try to tell you a\n",
      "little about one of his voyages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, and when he was only fourteen years old he was sent to\n",
      "Emanuel College, Cambridge. There he remained till he was seventeen, but his father had not\n",
      "money enough to keep him any longer at the University. So, as was then the custom for those\n",
      "who meant to become doctors, he was bound apprentice to a surgeon in London, under whom he\n",
      "studied for four years. But all the time, as often as his father sent him money, he spent some\n",
      "of it in learning navigation (which means the art of finding your way across the sea, far from\n",
      "land). He had always had a great longing to travel, and he thought that a knowledge of navigation\n",
      "would be of use to him if he should happen to go a voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "After leaving London, he went to Germany, and there studied medicine for some years, with the\n",
      "view of being appointed surgeon of a ship. And by the help of his late master in London, such\n",
      "a post he did get on board the \"Swallow\" on which vessel he made several voyages. But tiring\n",
      "of this, he settled in London, and, having married, began practise as a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not, however, make much money at that, and so for six years he again went to sea as\n",
      "a surgeon, sailing both to the East and to the West Indies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again tiring of the sea, he once more settled on shore, this time at Wapping, because in that\n",
      "place there are always many sailors, and he hoped to make money by doctoring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this turned out badly, and on May 4, 1699, he sailed from Bristol for the South Seas as\n",
      "surgeon of a ship named the \"Antelope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "GULLIVER IS WRECKED ON THE COAST OF LILLIPUT\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, everything went well, but after leaving the South Seas, when steering for the East\n",
      "Indies, the ship was driven by a great storm far to the south. The gale lasted so long that\n",
      "twelve of the crew died from the effects of the hard work and the bad food, and all the others\n",
      "were worn out and weak. On a sailing ship, when the weather is very heavy, all hands have to\n",
      "be constantly on deck, and there is little rest for the men. Perhaps a sail, one of the few\n",
      "that can still be carried in such a gale, may be blown to ribbons by the furious wind, and\n",
      "a new one has to be bent on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night, perhaps, is dark, the tattered canvas is thrashing with a noise like thunder, the\n",
      "ship burying her decks under angry black seas every few minutes. The men's hands are numb with\n",
      "the cold and the wet, and the hard, dangerous work aloft. There is no chance of going below\n",
      "when their job is done, to \"turn in\" between warm, dry blankets in a snug berth. Possibly even\n",
      "those who belong to the \"watch below\" may have to remain on deck. Or, if they have the good\n",
      "fortune to be allowed to go below, they may no sooner have dropped off asleep (rolled round\n",
      "in blankets which perhaps have been wet ever since the gale began) than there is a thump, thump\n",
      "overhead, and one of the watch on deck bellows down the forecastle-hatch, \"All hands shorten\n",
      "sail.\" And out they must tumble again, once more to battle with the hungry, roaring seas and\n",
      "the raging wind. So, when there has been a long spell of bad weather, it is no wonder that\n",
      "the men are worn out. And when, as was the case with Gulliver's ship, the food also is bad,\n",
      "it is easy to understand why so many of the crew had died.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the 5th of November, the beginning of summer in latitudes south of the equator. The\n",
      "storm had not yet cleared off, and the weather was very thick, the wind coming in furious squalls\n",
      "that drove the ship along at great speed, when suddenly from the lookout man came a wild cry--\"Breakers\n",
      "ahead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But so close had the vessel come to the rocks before they were seen through the thick driving\n",
      "spray, that immediately, with, a heavy plunge, she crashed into the reef, and split her bows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver and six of the crew lowered a boat and got clear of the wreck and of the breakers.\n",
      "But the men were so weak from overwork that they could not handle the boat in such a sea, and\n",
      "very soon, during a fierce squall, she sank. What became of the men Gulliver never knew, for\n",
      "he saw none of them again. Probably they were drowned at once, for they were too weak to keep\n",
      "long afloat in a sea breaking so heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed, Gulliver himself was like to have been lost. He swam till no strength or feeling\n",
      "was left in his arms and legs, swam bravely, his breath coming in great sobs, his eyes blinded\n",
      "with the salt seas that broke over his head. Still he struggled on, utterly spent, until at\n",
      "last, in a part where the wind seemed to have less force, and the seas swept over him less\n",
      "furiously, on letting down his legs he found that he was within his depth. But the shore shelved\n",
      "so gradually that for nearly a mile he had to wade wearily through shallow water, till, fainting\n",
      "almost with fatigue, he reached dry land.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time darkness was coming on, and there were no signs of houses or of people. He staggered\n",
      "forward but a little distance, and then, on the short, soft turf, sank down exhausted and slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he woke, the sun was shining, and he tried to rise; but not by any means could he stir\n",
      "hand or foot. Gulliver had fallen asleep lying on his back, and now he found that his arms\n",
      "and legs were tightly fastened to the ground. Across his body were numbers of thin but strong\n",
      "cords, and even his hair, which was very long, was pegged down so securely that he could not\n",
      "turn his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "All round about him there was a confused sound of voices, but he could see nothing except the\n",
      "sky, and the sun shone so hot and fierce into his eyes that he could scarcely keep them open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he felt something come gently up his left leg, and forward on to his breast almost to\n",
      "his chin. Looking down as much as possible, he saw standing there a very little man, not more\n",
      "than six inches high, armed with a bow and arrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then many more small men began to swarm over him. Gulliver let out such a roar of wonder and\n",
      "fright that they all turned and ran, many of them getting bad falls in their hurry to get out\n",
      "of danger. But very quickly the little people came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, with a great struggle Gulliver managed to break the cords that fastened his left\n",
      "arm, and at the same time, by a violent wrench that hurt him dreadfully, he slightly loosened\n",
      "the strings that fastened his hair, so that he was able to turn his head a little to one side.\n",
      "But the little men were too quick for him, and got out of reach before he could catch any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he heard a great shouting, followed by a shrill little voice that called sharply, \"Tolgo\n",
      "phonac,\" and immediately, arrows like needles were shot into his hand, and another volley struck\n",
      "him in the face. Poor Gulliver covered his face with his hand, and lay groaning with pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he struggled to get loose. But the harder he fought for freedom, the more the little\n",
      "men shot arrows into him, and some of them even tried to run their spears into his sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he found that the more he struggled the more he was hurt, Gulliver lay still, thinking\n",
      "to himself that at night at least, now that his left hand was free, he could easily get rid\n",
      "of the rest of his bonds. As soon as the little people saw that he struggled no more, they\n",
      "ceased shooting at him; but he knew from the increasing sound of voices that more and more\n",
      "of the little soldiers were coming round him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, a few yards from him, on the right, he heard a continued sound of hammering, and on turning\n",
      "his head to that side as far as the strings would let him, he saw that a small wooden stage\n",
      "was being built. On to this, when it was finished, there climbed by ladders four men, and one\n",
      "of them (who seemed to be a very important person, for a little page boy attended to hold up\n",
      "his train) immediately gave an order. At once about fifty of the soldiers ran forward and cut\n",
      "the strings that tied Gulliver's hair on the left side, so that he could turn his head easily\n",
      "to the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the person began to make a long speech, not one word of which could Gulliver understand,\n",
      "but it seemed to him that sometimes the little man threatened, and sometimes made offers of\n",
      "kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as he could, Gulliver made signs that he submitted. Then, feeling by this time faint\n",
      "with hunger, he pointed with his fingers many times to his mouth, to show that he wanted something\n",
      "to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They understood him very well. Several ladders were put against Gulliver's sides, and about\n",
      "a hundred little people climbed up and carried to his mouth all kinds of bread and meat. There\n",
      "were things shaped like legs, and shoulders, and saddles of mutton. Very good they were, Gulliver\n",
      "thought, but very small, no bigger than a lark's wing; and the loaves of bread were about the\n",
      "size of bullets, so that he could take several at a mouthful. The people wondered greatly at\n",
      "the amount that he ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he signed that he was thirsty, they slung up on to his body two of their biggest casks\n",
      "of wine, and having rolled them forward to his hand they knocked out the heads of the casks.\n",
      "Gulliver drank them both off at a draught, and asked for more, for they held only about a small\n",
      "tumblerful each. But there was no more to be had.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the small people walked to and fro over his body, Gulliver was sorely tempted to seize forty\n",
      "or fifty of them and dash them on the ground, and then to make a further struggle for liberty.\n",
      "But the pain he had already suffered from their arrows made him think better of it, and he\n",
      "wisely lay quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon another small man, who from his brilliant uniform seemed to be an officer of very high\n",
      "rank, marched with some others on to Gulliver's chest and held up to his eyes a paper which\n",
      "Gulliver understood to be an order from the King of the country. The officer made a long speech,\n",
      "often pointing towards something a long way off, and (as Gulliver afterwards learned) told\n",
      "him that he was to be taken as a prisoner to the city, the capital of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver asked, by signs, that his bonds might be loosed. The officer shook his head and refused,\n",
      "but he allowed some of his soldiers to slack the cords on one side, whereby Gulliver was able\n",
      "to feel more comfortable. After this, the little people drew out the arrows that still stuck\n",
      "in his hands and face, and rubbed the wounds with some pleasant-smelling ointment, which so\n",
      "soothed his pain that very soon he fell sound asleep. And this was no great wonder, for, as\n",
      "he afterwards understood, the King's physicians had mixed a very strong sleeping draught with\n",
      "the wine that had been given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver awoke with a violent fit of sneezing, and with the feeling of small feet running away\n",
      "from off his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where was he? Bound still, without doubt, but no longer did he find himself lying on the ground.\n",
      "It puzzled him greatly that now he lay on a sort of platform. How had he got there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he began to realize what had happened; and later, when he understood the language, he\n",
      "learned all that had been done to him while he slept. Before he dropped asleep, he had heard\n",
      "a rumbling as of wheels, and the shouts of many drivers. This, it seemed, was caused by the\n",
      "arrival of a huge kind of trolley, a few inches high, but nearly seven feet long, drawn by\n",
      "fifteen hundred of the King's largest horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this it was meant that he should be taken to the city. By the use of strong poles fixed\n",
      "in the ground, to which were attached many pulleys, and the strongest ropes to be found in\n",
      "the country, nine hundred men managed to hoist him as he slept. They then put him on the trolley,\n",
      "where they again tied him fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was when they were far on their way to the city that Gulliver awoke. The trolley had stopped\n",
      "for a little to breathe the horses, and one of the officers of the King's Guard who had not\n",
      "before seen Gulliver, climbed with some friends up his body. While looking at his face, the\n",
      "officer could not resist the temptation of putting the point of his sword up Gulliver's nose,\n",
      "which tickled him so that he woke, sneezing violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "GULLIVER IS TAKEN AS A PRISONER TO THE CAPITAL OF LILLIPUT\n",
      "\n",
      "The city was not reached till the following day, and Gulliver had to spend the night lying\n",
      "where he was, guarded on each side by five hundred men with torches and bows and arrows, ready\n",
      "to shoot him if he should attempt to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, the King and all his court, and thousands of the people, came out to gaze on\n",
      "the wonderful sight. The trolley, with Gulliver on it, stopped outside the walls, alongside\n",
      "a very large building which had once been used as a temple, but the use of which had been given\n",
      "up owing to a murder having been committed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of this temple was quite four feet high and about two feet wide, and on each side,\n",
      "about six inches from the ground, was a small window. Inside the building the King's blacksmiths\n",
      "fastened many chains, which they then brought through one of these little windows and padlocked\n",
      "round Gulliver's left ankle. Then his bonds were cut, and he was allowed to get up. He found\n",
      "that he could easily creep through the door, and that there was room inside to lie down.\n",
      "\n",
      "His chains were nearly six feet long, so that he could get a little exercise by walking backwards\n",
      "and forwards outside. Always when he walked, thousands of people thronged around to look at\n",
      "him; even the King himself used to come and gaze by the hour from a high tower which stood\n",
      "opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, just as Gulliver had crept out from his house and had got on his feet, it chanced\n",
      "that the King, who was a very fine-looking man, taller than any of his people, came riding\n",
      "along on his great white charger. When the horse saw Gulliver move it was terrified, and plunged\n",
      "and reared so madly that the people feared that a terrible accident was going to happen, and\n",
      "several of the King's guards ran in to seize the horse by the head. But the King was a good\n",
      "horseman, and managed the animal so well that very soon it got over its fright, and he was\n",
      "able to dismount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he gave orders that food should be brought for Gulliver, twenty little carts full, and\n",
      "ten of wine; and he and his courtiers, all covered with gold and silver, stood around and watched\n",
      "him eating. After the King had gone away the people of the city crowded round, and some of\n",
      "them began to behave very badly, one man even going so far as to shoot an arrow at Gulliver\n",
      "which was not far from putting out one of his eyes. But the officer in command of the soldiers\n",
      "who were on guard ordered his men to bind and push six of the worst behaved of the crowd within\n",
      "reach of Gulliver, who at once seized five of them and put them in his coat pocket. The sixth\n",
      "he held up to his mouth and made as if he meant to eat him, whereupon the wretched little creature\n",
      "shrieked aloud with terror, and when Gulliver took out his knife, all the people, even the\n",
      "soldiers, were dreadfully alarmed. But Gulliver only cut the man's bonds, and let him run away,\n",
      "which he did in a great hurry. And when he took the others out of his pocket, one by one, and\n",
      "treated them in the same way, the crowd began to laugh. After that the people always behaved\n",
      "very well to Gulliver, and he became a great favorite. From all over the kingdom crowds flocked\n",
      "to see the Great Man Mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, as Gulliver learned later, there were frequent meetings of the King's council\n",
      "to discuss the question of what was to be done with him. Some of the councilors feared lest\n",
      "he might break loose and cause great damage in the city. Some were of opinion that to keep\n",
      "and feed so huge a creature would cause a famine in the land, or, at the least, that the expense\n",
      "would be greater than the public funds could bear; they advised, therefore, that he should\n",
      "be killed--shot in the hands and face with poisoned arrows. Others, however, argued that if\n",
      "this were done it would be a very difficult thing to get rid of so large a dead body, which\n",
      "might cause a pestilence to break out if it lay long unburied so near the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the King and his council gave orders that each morning the surrounding villages should\n",
      "send into the city for Gulliver's daily use six oxen, forty sheep, and a sufficient quantity\n",
      "of bread and wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also commanded that six hundred persons should act as his servants; that three hundred\n",
      "tailors were to make for him a suit of clothes; and that six professors from the University\n",
      "were to teach him the language of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Gulliver could speak the language, he learned a great deal about the land in which he\n",
      "now found himself. It was called Lilliput, and the people, Lilliputians. These Lilliputians\n",
      "believed that their kingdom and the neighboring country of Blefuscu were the whole world. Blefuscu\n",
      "lay far over the sea, to these little people dim and blue on the horizon, though to Gulliver\n",
      "the distance did not seem to be more than a mile. The Lilliputians knew of no land beyond Blefuscu.\n",
      "And as for Gulliver himself, they believed that he had fallen from the moon, or from one of\n",
      "the stars; it was impossible, they said, that so big a race of men could live on the earth.\n",
      "It was quite certain that there could not be food enough for them. They did not believe Gulliver's\n",
      "story. He must have fallen from the moon!\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost the first thing that Gulliver did when he knew the language fairly well, was to send\n",
      "a petition to the King, praying that his chains might be taken off and that he might be free\n",
      "to walk about. But this he was told could not then be granted. He must first, the King's council\n",
      "said, \"swear a peace\" with the kingdom of Lilliput, and afterwards, if by continued good behavior\n",
      "he gained their confidence, he might be freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, by the King's orders, two high officers of state were sent to search him, Gulliver\n",
      "lifted up these officers in his hand and put them into each of his pockets, one after the other,\n",
      "and they made for the King a careful list of everything found there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver afterward saw this inventory. His snuff-box they had described as a \"huge silver chest,\n",
      "full of a sort of dust.\" Into that dust one of them stepped, and the snuff, flying up in his\n",
      "face, caused him nearly to sneeze his head off. His pistols they called \"hollow pillars of\n",
      "iron, fastened to strong pieces of timber,\" and the use of his bullets, and of his powder (which\n",
      "he had been lucky enough to bring ashore dry, owing to his pouch being water-tight), they could\n",
      "not understand, while of his watch they could make nothing. They called it \"a wonderful kind\n",
      "of engine, which makes an incessant noise like a water-wheel.\" But some fancied that it was\n",
      "perhaps a kind of animal. Certainly it was alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things, together with his sword, which he carried slung to a belt round his waist,\n",
      "Gulliver had to give up, first, as well as he could, explaining the use of them. The Lilliputians\n",
      "could not understand the pistols, and to show his meaning, Gulliver was obliged to fire one\n",
      "of them. At once hundreds of little people fell down as if they had been struck dead by the\n",
      "noise. Even the King, though he stood his ground, was sorely frightened. Most of Gulliver's\n",
      "property was returned to him; but the pistols and powder and bullets, and his sword, were taken\n",
      "away and put, for safety, under strict guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the King and his courtiers gained more faith in Gulliver, and became less afraid of his\n",
      "breaking loose and doing some mischief, they began to treat him in a more friendly way than\n",
      "they had hitherto done, and showed him more of the manners and customs of the country. Some\n",
      "of these were very curious.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the sports of which they were most fond was rope-dancing, and there was no more certain\n",
      "means of being promoted to high office and power in the state than to possess great cleverness\n",
      "in that art. Indeed, it was said that the Lord High Treasurer had gained and kept his post\n",
      "chiefly through his great skill in turning somersaults on the tight rope. The Chief Secretary\n",
      "for private affairs ran him very close, and there was hardly a Minister of State who did not\n",
      "owe his position to such successes. Few of them, indeed, had escaped without severe accidents\n",
      "at one time or another, while trying some specially difficult feat, and many had been lamed\n",
      "for life. But however many and bad the falls, there were always plenty of other persons to\n",
      "attempt the same or some more difficult jump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taught by his narrow escape from a serious accident when his horse first saw Gulliver, the\n",
      "King now gave orders that the horses of his army, as well as those from the Royal stables,\n",
      "should be exercised daily close to the Man Mountain. Soon they became so used to the sight\n",
      "of him that they would come right up to his foot without starting or shying. Often the riders\n",
      "would jump their chargers over Gulliver's hand as he held it on the ground; and once the King's\n",
      "huntsman, better mounted than most of the others, actually jumped over his foot, shoe and all--a\n",
      "wonderful leap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver saw that it was wise to amuse the King in this and other ways, because the more his\n",
      "Majesty was pleased with him the sooner was it likely that his liberty would be granted. So\n",
      "he asked one day that some strong sticks, about two feet in height, should be brought to him.\n",
      "Several of these he fixed firmly in the ground, and across them, near the top, he lashed four\n",
      "other sticks, enclosing a square space of about two and a half feet. Then to the uprights,\n",
      "about five inches lower than the crossed sticks, he tied his pocket-handkerchief, and stretched\n",
      "it tight as a drum.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the work was finished, he asked the King to let a troop exercise on this stage. His Majesty\n",
      "was delighted with the idea, and for several days nothing pleased him more than to see Gulliver\n",
      "lift up the men and horses, and to watch them go through their drill on this platform. Sometimes\n",
      "he would even be lifted up himself and give the words of command; and once he persuaded the\n",
      "Queen, who was rather timid, to let herself be held up in her chair within full view of the\n",
      "scene. But a fiery horse one day, pawing with his hoof, wore a hole in the handkerchief, and\n",
      "came down heavily on its side, and after this Gulliver could no longer trust the strength of\n",
      "his stage.\n",

      "By this time Gulliver's clothes were almost in rags. The three hundred tailors had not yet\n",
      "been able to finish his new suit, and he had no hat at all, for that had been lost as he came\n",
      "ashore from the wreck. So he was greatly pleased one day when an express message came to the\n",
      "King from the coast, saying that some men had found on the shore a great, black, strangely-shaped\n",
      "mass, as high as a man; it was not alive, they were certain. It had never moved, though for\n",
      "a time they had watched, before going closer. After making certain that it was not likely to\n",
      "injure them, by mounting on each other's shoulders they had got on the top, which they found\n",
      "was flat and smooth, and, by the sound when stamped upon, they judged that it was hollow. It\n",
      "was thought that the object might possibly be something belonging to the Man Mountain, and\n",
      "they proposed by the help of five horses to bring it to the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver was sure that it must be his hat, and so it turned out. Nor was it very greatly damaged,\n",
      "either by the sea or by being drawn by the horses over the ground all the way from the coast,\n",
      "except that two holes had been bored in the brim, to which a long cord had been fixed by hooks.\n",
      "Gulliver was much pleased to have it once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after this the King took into his head a curious fancy. He ordered a review of troops\n",
      "to be held, and he directed that Gulliver should stand with his legs very wide apart, while\n",
      "under him both horse and foot were commanded to march. Over three thousand infantry and one\n",
      "thousand cavalry passed through the great arch made by his legs, colors flying and bands playing.\n",
      "The King and Queen themselves sat in their State Coach at the saluting point, near to his left\n",
      "leg, and all the while Gulliver dared not move a hair's-breadth, lest he should injure some\n",
      "of the soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after this, Gulliver was set free. There had been a meeting of the King's Council on\n",
      "the subject, and the Lord High Admiral was the only member in favor of still keeping him chained.\n",
      "This great officer to the end was Gulliver's bitter enemy, and though on this occasion he was\n",
      "out-voted, yet he was allowed to draw up the conditions which Gulliver was to sign before his\n",
      "chains were struck off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conditions were:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, that he was not to quit the country without leave granted under the King's Great Seal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, that he was not to come into the city without orders; at which times the people were\n",
      "to have two hours' notice to keep indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, that he should keep to the high roads, and not walk or lie down in a meadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, that he was to take the utmost care not to trample on anybody, or on any horses or\n",
      "carriages, and that he was not to lift any persons in his hand against their will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, that if at any time an express had to be sent in great haste, he was to carry the messenger\n",
      "and his horse in his pocket a six-days' journey, and to bring them safely back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, that he should be the King's ally against the Blefuscans, and that he should try to\n",
      "destroy their fleet, which was said to be preparing to invade Lilliput.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventh, that he should help the workmen to move certain great stones which were needed to\n",
      "repair some of the public buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighth, that he should in \"two moons' time\" make an exact survey of the kingdom, by counting\n",
      "how many of his own paces it took him to go all round the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, on his swearing to the above conditions, it was promised that he should have a daily\n",
      "allowance of meat and drink equal to the amount consumed by seventeen hundred and twenty-four\n",
      "of the Lilliputians, for they estimated that Gulliver's size was about equal to that number\n",

      "\n",
      "Though one or two of the conditions did not please him, especially that about helping the workmen\n",
      "(which he thought was making him too much a servant), yet Gulliver signed the document at once,\n",
      "and swore to observe its conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After having done so, and having had his chains removed, the first thing he asked was to be\n",
      "allowed to see the city (which was called Mildendo). He found that it was surrounded by a great\n",
      "wall about two and a half feet high, broad enough for one of their coaches and four to be driven\n",
      "along, and at every ten feet there were strong flanking towers.\n",

      "houses, and he then stepped over the wall and very carefully walked down the finest of the\n",
      "streets, one quite five feet wide. Wherever he went, the tops of the houses and the attic windows\n",
      "were packed with wondering spectators, and he reckoned that the town must hold quite half a\n",
      "million of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the center of the city, where the two chief streets met, stood the King's Palace, a very\n",
      "fine building surrounded by a wall. But he was not able to see the whole palace that day, because\n",
      "the part in which were the royal apartments was shut off by another wall nearly five feet in\n",
      "height, which he could not get over without a risk of doing damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days later he climbed over by the help of two stools which he made from some of the largest\n",
      "trees in the Royal Park, trees nearly seven feet high, which he was allowed to cut down for\n",
      "the purpose. By putting one of the stools at each side of the wall Gulliver was able to step\n",
      "across. Then, lying down on his side, and putting his face close to the open windows, he looked\n",
      "in and saw the Queen and all the young Princes. The Queen smiled, and held her hand out of\n",
      "one of the windows, that he might kiss it. She was very pleasant and friendly.\n",

      "One day, about a fortnight after this, there came to call on him, Reldresal, the King's Chief\n",
      "Secretary, a very great man, one who had always been Gulliver's very good friend. This person\n",
      "had a long and serious talk with Gulliver about the state of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that though to the outward eye things in Lilliput seemed very settled and prosperous,\n",
      "yet in reality there were troubles, both internal and external, that threatened the safety\n",
      "of the kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been in Lilliput for a very long time two parties at bitter enmity with each other,\n",
      "so bitter that they would neither eat, drink, nor talk together, and what one party did, the\n",
      "other would always try to undo. Each professed to believe that nothing good could come from\n",
      "the other. Any measure proposed by the party in power was by the other always looked upon as\n",
      "foolish or evil. And any new law passed by the Government party was said by the Opposition\n",
      "to be either a wicked attack on the liberties of the people, or something undertaken solely\n",
      "for the purpose of keeping that party in, and the Opposition out, of power. To such a pitch\n",
      "had things now come, said the Chief Secretary, entirely owing to the folly of the Opposition,\n",
      "that the business of the kingdom was almost at a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime the country was in danger of an invasion by the Blefuscans, who were now fitting out\n",
      "a great fleet, which was almost ready to sail to attack Lilliput. The war with Blefuscu had\n",
      "been raging for some years, and the losses by both nations of ships and of men had been very heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This war had broken out in the following way. It had always been the custom in Lilliput, as\n",
      "far back as history went, for people when breaking an egg at breakfast to do so at the big\n",
      "end. But it had happened, said the Chief Secretary, that the present King's grandfather, when\n",
      "a boy, had once when breaking his egg in the usual way, severely cut his finger. Whereupon\n",
      "his father at once gave strict commands that in future all his subjects should break their\n",
      "eggs at the small end.\n",
      "\n",
      "This greatly angered the people, who thought that the King had no right to give such an order,\n",
      "and they refused to obey. As a consequence no less than six rebellions had taken place: thousands\n",
      "of the Lilliputians had had their heads cut off, or had been cast into prison, and thousands\n",
      "had fled for refuge to Blefuscu, rather than obey the hated order.\n",
      "\n",
      "These \"Big endians,\" as they were called, had been very well received at the Court of Blefuscu,\n",
      "and finally the Emperor of that country had taken upon himself to interfere in the affairs\n",
      "of Lilliput, thus bringing on war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chief Secretary ended the talk by saying that the King, having great faith in Gulliver's\n",
      "strength, and depending on the oath which he had sworn before being released, expected him\n",
      "now to help in defeating the Blefuscan fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver was very ready to do what he could, and he at once thought of a plan whereby he might\n",
      "destroy the whole fleet at one blow. He told all his ideas on the subject to the King, who\n",
      "gave orders that everything he might need should be supplied without delay. Then Gulliver went\n",
      "to the oldest seamen in the navy, and learned from them the depth of water between Lilliput\n",
      "and Blefuscu. It was, they said, nowhere deeper than seventy glumgluffs (which is equal to\n",
      "about six feet) at high water, and there was no great extent so deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this he walked to the coast opposite Blefuscu, and lying down there behind a hillock,\n",
      "so that he might not be seen should any of the enemy's ships happen to be cruising near, he\n",
      "looked long through a small pocket-telescope across the channel. With the naked eye he could\n",
      "easily see the cliffs of Blefuscu, and soon with his telescope he made out where the fleet\n",
      "lay--fifty great men-of-war, and many transports, waiting for a fair wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming back to the city, he gave orders for a great length of the strongest cable, and a quantity\n",
      "of bars of iron. The cable was little thicker than ordinary pack-thread, and the bars of iron\n",
      "much about the length and size of knitting-needles. Gulliver twisted three of the iron bars\n",
      "together and bent them to a hook at one end. He trebled the cable for greater strength, and\n",
      "thus made fifty shorter cables, to which he fastened the hooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, carrying these in his hand, he walked back to the coast and waded into the sea, a little\n",
      "before high water. When he came to mid-channel, he had to swim, but for no great distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they noticed Gulliver coming wading through the water towards their ships, the Blefuscan\n",
      "sailors all jumped overboard and swam ashore in a terrible fright. Never before had any of\n",
      "them seen or dreamt of so monstrous a giant, nor had they heard of his being in Lilliput.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver then quietly took his cables and fixed one securely in the bows of each of the ships\n",
      "of war, and finally he tied the cables together at his end. But while he was doing this the\n",
      "Blefuscan soldiers on the shore plucked up courage and began to shoot arrows at him, many of\n",
      "which stuck in his hands and face. He was very much afraid lest some of these might put out\n",
      "his eyes; but he remembered, luckily, that in his inner pocket were his spectacles, which he\n",
      "put on, and then finished his work without risk to his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On pulling at the cables, however, not a ship could he move. He had forgotten that their anchors\n",
      "were all down. So he was forced to go in closer and with his knife to cut the vessels free.\n",
      "While doing this he was of course exposed to a furious fire from the enemy, and hundreds of\n",
      "arrows struck him, some almost knocking off his spectacles. But again he hauled, and this time\n",
      "drew the whole fifty vessels after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blefuscans had thought that it was his intention merely to cast the vessels adrift, so\n",
      "that they might run aground, but when they saw their great fleet being steadily drawn out to\n",
      "sea, their grief was terrible. For a great distance Gulliver could hear their cries of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had got well away from the land, he stopped in order to pick the arrows from his face\n",
      "and hands, and to put on some of the ointment that had been rubbed on his wounds when first\n",
      "the Lilliputians fired into him. By this time the tide had fallen a little, and he was able\n",
      "to wade all the way across the channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King and his courtiers stood waiting on the shore. They could see the vessels steadily\n",
      "drawing nearer, but they could not for some time see Gulliver, because only his head was above\n",
      "water. At first some imagined that he had been drowned, and that the fleet was now on its way\n",
      "to attack Lilliput.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was great joy when Gulliver was seen hauling the vessels; and when he landed, the King\n",
      "was so pleased that on the spot he created him a Nardac, the highest honor that it was in his\n",
      "power to bestow.\n",
      "\n",
      "His great success over the Blefuscans, however, turned out to be but the beginning of trouble\n",
      "for Gulliver. The King was so puffed up by the victory that he formed plans for capturing in\n",
      "the same way the whole of the enemy's ships of every kind. And it was now his wish to crush\n",
      "Blefuscu utterly, and to make it nothing but a province depending on Lilliput. Thus, he thought,\n",
      "he himself would then be monarch of the whole world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scheme Gulliver refused to take any part, and he very plainly said that he would give\n",
      "no help in making slaves of the Blefuscans. This refusal angered the King very much, and more\n",
      "than once he artfully brought the matter up at a State Council. Now, several of the councilors,\n",
      "though they pretended to be Gulliver's friends so long as he was in favor with the King, were\n",
      "really his secret enemies, and nothing pleased these persons better than to see that the King\n",
      "was no longer pleased with him. So they did all in their power to nurse and increase the King's\n",
      "anger, and to make him believe that Gulliver was a traitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time there came to Lilliput ambassadors from Blefuscu, suing for peace. When a treaty\n",
      "had been made and signed (very greatly to the advantage of Lilliput), the Blefuscan ambassadors\n",
      "asked to see the Great Man Mountain, of whom they had heard so much, and they paid Gulliver\n",
      "a formal call. After asking him to give them some proofs of his strength, they invited him\n",
      "to visit their Emperor, which Gulliver promised to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the next time that he met the King, he asked, as he was bound to do by the paper\n",
      "he had signed, for permission to leave the country for a time, in order to visit Blefuscu.\n",
      "The King did not refuse, but his manner was so cold that Gulliver could not help noticing it.\n",
      "Afterwards he learned from a friend that his enemies in the council had told the King lying\n",
      "tales of his meetings with the Blefuscan ambassadors, which had had the effect of still further\n",
      "rousing his anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened too, most unfortunately, at this time, that Gulliver had offended the Queen by\n",
      "a well-meant, but badly-managed, effort to do her a service, and thus he lost also her friendship.\n",
      "But though he was now out of favor at court, he was still an object of great interest to every one.\n",

      "in small huts which had been built for them near his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had made for himself a chair and a table. On to this table it was his custom to lift twenty\n",

      "\n",
      "But in this he erred, for it was turned against him. Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer, who\n",

      "meals, and told how this huge man had already cost the country over a million and a half of\n",

      "\n",
      "It was made a point against him that, when ordered to do so by the King, he had refused to\n",

      "the empire of Blefuscu, nor give aid when it was proposed to put to death not only all the\n",
      "Big endians who had fled for refuge to that country, but all the Blefuscans themselves who\n",
      "were friends of the Big-endians. For this he was said to be a traitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was also accused of being over-friendly with the Blefuscan ambassadors; and it was made\n",

      "\n",
      "There had been many debates on these charges, said the courtier, and the Lord High Admiral\n",
      "had made violent speeches, strongly advising that the Great Man Mountain should be put to death.\n",
      "In this he was joined by Flimnap, and by others, so that actually the greater part of the council\n",
      "was in favor of instant death by the most painful means that could be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The less unfriendly members of the council, however, while saying that they had no doubt of\n",
      "Gulliver's guilt, were yet of the opinion that, as his services to the kingdom of Lilliput\n",
      "had been great, the punishment of death was too severe. They thought it would be enough if\n",
      "his eyes were put out. This, they said, would not prevent him from being still made useful.\n",

      "\n",
      "At last the Secretary rose and said that he had a middle course to suggest. This was, that\n",
      "Gulliver's eyes should be put out, and that thereafter his food should be gradually so reduced\n",
      "in quantity that in the course of two or three months he would die of starvation. By which\n",
      "time, said the Secretary, his body would be wasted to an extent that would make it easy for\n",
      "five or six hundred men, in a few days, to cut off the flesh and take it away in cart-loads\n",
      "to be buried at a distance. Thus there would be no danger of a pestilence breaking out from\n",

      "\n",
      "It was finally decided that this sentence should be carried out, and twenty of the King's surgeons\n",

      "him that he might visit Blefuscu, he had decided to do so that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without waiting for an answer, he set out for the coast, where he seized a large man-of-war\n",
      "which was at anchor there, tied a cable to her bow, and then putting his clothes and his blanket\n",
      "on board, he drew the ship after him to Blefuscu. There he was well received by the Emperor.\n",
      "But as there happened to be no house big enough for him, he was forced, during his stay, to\n",
      "sleep each night on the ground, wrapped in his blanket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days after his arrival, when walking along the seashore, he noticed something in the\n",
      "water which looked not unlike a boat floating bottom up. Gulliver waded and swam out, and found\n",
      "that he was right. It was a boat. By the help of some of the Blefsucan ships, with much difficulty\n",
      "he got it ashore. When the tide had fallen, two thousand of the Emperor's dockyard men helped\n",
      "him to turn it over, and Gulliver found that but little damage had been done.\n",

      "a traitor. To this message the Emperor replied that it was not possible to bind him; that moreover\n",

      "that it was his purpose to leave the Empire of Blefuscu in the course of a few weeks.\n",

      "Gulliver did not delay his work, and in less than a month he was ready to sail.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put on board the boat the carcasses of one hundred oxen and three hundred sheep, with a\n",
      "quantity of bread and wine, and as much meat ready cooked as four hundred cooks could prepare.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also took with him a herd of six live black cows and two bulls, and a flock of sheep, meaning\n",
      "to take them with him to England, if ever he should get there. As food for these animals he\n",
      "took a quantity of hay and corn.\n",

      "Gulliver would have liked to take with him some of the people, but this the Emperor would not\n",
      "permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything being ready, he sailed from Blefuscu on 24th September 1701, and the same night\n",
      "anchored on the lee side of an island which seemed to be uninhabited. Leaving this island on\n",
      "the following morning, he sailed to the eastward for two days. On the evening of the second\n",
      "day he sighted a ship, on reaching which, to his great joy, he found that she was an English\n",
      "vessel on her way home from Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting his cattle and sheep in his coat-pockets, he went on board with all his cargo of provisions.\n",

      "to be at sea in an open boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulliver told his tale in as few words as possible. The captain stared with wonder, and would\n",
      "not believe his story. But Gulliver then took from his pockets the black cattle and the sheep,\n",
      "which of course clearly showed that he had been speaking truth. He also showed gold coins which\n",
      "the Emperor of Blefuscu had given him, some of which he presented to the captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vessel did not arrive at the port of London till April, 1702, but there was no loss of\n",
      "the live stock, excepting that the rats on board carried off and ate one of the sheep. All\n",
      "the others were got safely ashore, and were put to graze on a bowling-green at Greenwich, where\n",
      "they throve very well. He had a wife whom he loved dearly and an only son whose name was Aladdin.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, sad to say, although the tailor was good and industrious, his son was so idle and bad\n",
      "that his father and mother did not know what to do with him. All day long he played in the\n",
      "streets with other idle boys, and when he grew big enough to learn a trade he said he did not\n",
      "mean to work at all. His poor father was very much troubled, and ordered Aladdin to come to\n",
      "the workshop to learn to be a tailor, but Aladdin only laughed, and ran away so swiftly that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said Mustapha sadly, \"I can do nothing with this idle boy.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" cried the wicked old Magician, pretending to weep, \"he was my brother, and thou must\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Tell thy dear mother that I will come and see her this very day,\" he cried, \"and give her\n",

      "But when she saw the gold she began to think that this stranger must be a relation, and so\n",
      "she prepared a grand supper to welcome him when he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not long to wait before the African Magician appeared, bringing with him all sorts\n",
      "of fruits and delicious sweets for desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me about my poor brother,\" he said, as he embraced Aladdin and his mother. \"Show me exactly\n",
      "where he used to sit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the widow pointed to a seat on the sofa, and the Magician knelt down and began to kiss\n",
      "the place and weep over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor widow was quite touched, and began to believe that this really must be her husband's\n",
      "brother, especially when he began to show the kindest interest in Aladdin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is thy trade?\" he asked the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said the widow, \"he will do nothing but play in the streets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin hung his head with shame as his uncle gravely shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must begin work at once,\" he said. \"How would it please thee to have a shop of thy own?\n",
      "I could buy one for thee, and stock it with silks and rich stuffs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin danced with joy at the very idea, and next day set out with his supposed uncle, who\n",
      "bought him a splendid suit of clothes, and took him all over the city to show him the sights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day after, the Magician again took Aladdin out with him, but this time they went outside\n",
      "the city, through beautiful gardens, into the open country. They walked so far that Aladdin\n",
      "began to grow weary, but the Magician gave him a cake and some delicious fruit and told him\n",
      "such wonderful tales that he scarcely noticed how far they had gone. At last they came to a\n",
      "deep valley between two mountains, and there the Magician paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" he cried, \"this is the very place I am in search of. Gather some sticks that we may\n",
      "make a fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin quickly did as he was bid, and had soon gathered together a great heap of dry sticks.\n",
      "The Magician then set fire to them, and the heap blazed up merrily. With great care the old\n",
      "man now sprinkled some curious-looking powder on the flames, and muttered strange words. In\n",
      "an instant the earth beneath their feet trembled, and they heard a rumbling like distant thunder.\n",
      "Then the ground opened in front of them, and showed a great square slab of stone with a ring in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Aladdin was so frightened that he turned to run home as fast as he could, but\n",
      "the Magician caught him, and gave him such a blow that he fell to the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why dost thou strike me, uncle?\" sobbed Aladdin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do as I bid thee,\" said the Magician, \"and then thou shalt be well treated. Dost thou see\n",
      "that stone? Beneath it is a treasure which I will share with thee. Only obey me, and it will\n",
      "soon be ours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Aladdin heard of a treasure, he jumped up and forgot all his fears. He seized the\n",
      "ring as the Magician directed, and easily pulled up the stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said the old man, \"look in and thou wilt see stone steps leading downwards. Thou shalt\n",
      "descend those steps until thou comest to three great halls. Pass through them, but take care\n",
      "to wrap thy coat well round thee that thou mayest touch nothing, for if thou dost, thou wilt\n",
      "die instantly. When thou hast passed through the halls thou wilt come into a garden of fruit-trees.\n",
      "Go through it until thou seest a niche with a lighted lamp in it. Put the light out, pour forth\n",
      "the oil, and bring the lamp to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying the Magician placed a magic ring upon Aladdin's finger to guard him, and bade the\n",
      "boy begin his search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin did exactly as he was told and found everything just as the Magician had said. He went\n",
      "through the halls and the garden until he came to the lamp, and when he had poured out the\n",
      "oil and placed the lamp carefully inside his coat he began to look about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never seen such a lovely garden before, even in his dreams. The fruits that hung upon\n",
      "the trees were of every color of the rainbow. Some were clear and shining like crystal, some\n",
      "sparkled with a crimson light and others were green, blue, violet, and orange, while the leaves\n",
      "that shaded them were silver and gold. Aladdin did not guess that these fruits were precious\n",
      "stones, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, but they looked so pretty that he filled\n",
      "all his pockets with them as he passed back through the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Magician was eagerly peering down the stone steps when Aladdin began to climb up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me the lamp,\" he cried, stretching his hand for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait until I get out,\" answered Aladdin, \"and then I will give it thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hand it up to me at once,\" screamed the old man angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not till I am safely out,\" repeated Aladdin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Magician stamped with rage, and rushing to the fire threw on it some more of the curious\n",
      "powder, uttered the same strange words as before, and instantly the stone slipped back into\n",
      "its place, the earth closed over it, and Aladdin was left in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This showed indeed that the wicked old man was not Aladdin's uncle. By his magic arts in Africa\n",
      "he had found out all about the lamp, which was a wonderful treasure, as you will see. But he\n",
      "knew that he could not get it himself, that another hand must fetch it to him. This was the\n",
      "reason why he had fixed upon Aladdin to help him, and had meant, as soon as the lamp was safely\n",
      "in his hand, to kill the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his plan had failed he went back to Africa, and was not seen again for a long, long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was poor Aladdin shut up underground, with no way of getting out! He tried to find\n",
      "his way back to the great halls and the beautiful garden of shining fruits, but the walls had\n",
      "closed up, and there was no escape that way either. For two days the poor boy sat crying and\n",
      "moaning in his despair, and just as he had made up his mind that he must die, he clasped his\n",
      "hands together, and in doing so rubbed the ring which the Magician had put upon his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant a huge figure rose out of the earth and stood before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is thy will, my master?\" it said. \"I am the Slave of the Ring, and must obey him who\n",
      "wears the ring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever or whatever you are,\" cried Aladdin, \"take me out of this dreadful place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely had he said these words when the earth opened, and the next moment Aladdin found himself\n",
      "lying at his mother's door. He was so weak for want of food, and his joy at seeing his mother\n",
      "was so great, that he fainted away, but when he came to himself he promised to tell her all\n",
      "that had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But first give me something to eat,\" he cried, \"for I am dying of hunger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said his mother, \"I have nothing in the house except a little cotton, which I will\n",
      "go out and sell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop a moment,\" cried Aladdin, \"rather let us sell this old lamp which I have brought back\n",
      "with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the lamp looked so old and dirty that Aladdin's mother began to rub it, wishing to brighten\n",
      "it a little that it might fetch a higher price.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner had she given it the first rub than a huge dark figure slowly rose from the floor\n",
      "like a wreath of smoke until it reached the ceiling, towering above them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is thy will?\" it asked. \"I am the Slave of the Lamp, and must do the bidding of him who\n",
      "holds the Lamp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment the figure began to rise from the ground Aladdin's mother was so terrified that\n",
      "she fainted away, but Aladdin managed to snatch the lamp from her, although he could scarcely\n",
      "hold it in his own shaking hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fetch me something to eat,\" he said in a trembling voice, for the terrible Genie was glaring\n",
      "down upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Slave of the Lamp disappeared in a cloud of smoke, but in an instant he was back again,\n",
      "bringing with him a most delicious breakfast, served upon plates and dishes of pure gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Aladdin's mother had recovered, but she was almost too frightened to eat, and\n",
      "begged Aladdin to sell the lamp at once, for she was sure it had something to do with evil\n",
      "spirits. But Aladdin only laughed at her fears, and said he meant to make use of the magic\n",
      "lamp and wonderful ring, now that he knew their worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they again wanted money they sold the golden plates and dishes, and when these were\n",
      "all gone Aladdin ordered the Genie to bring more, and so they lived in comfort for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aladdin had heard a great deal about the beauty of the Sultan's daughter, and he began\n",
      "to long so greatly to see her that he could not rest. He thought of a great many plans, but\n",
      "they all seemed impossible, for the Princess never went out without a veil, which covered her\n",
      "entirely. At last, however, he managed to enter the palace and hide himself behind a door,\n",
      "peeping through a chink when the Princess passed to go to her bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Aladdin's eyes rested upon the beautiful Princess he loved her with all his heart,\n",
      "for she was as fair as the dawn of a summer morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother,\" he cried when he reached home, \"I have seen the Princess, and I have made up my mind\n",
      "to marry her. Thou shalt go at once to the Sultan, and beg him to give me his daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin's mother stared at her son, and then began to laugh at such a wild idea. She was almost\n",
      "afraid that Aladdin must be mad, but he gave her no peace until she did as he wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the next day she very unwillingly set out for the palace, carrying the magic fruit wrapped\n",
      "up in a napkin, to present to the Sultan. There were many other people offering their petitions\n",
      "that day, and the poor woman was so frightened that she dared not go forward, and so no one\n",
      "paid any attention to her as she stood there patiently holding her bundle. For a whole week\n",
      "she had gone every day to the palace, before the Sultan noticed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is that poor woman who comes every day carrying a white bundle?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Grand Vizier ordered that she should be brought forward, and she came bowing herself\n",
      "to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was almost too terrified to speak, but when the Sultan spoke so kindly to her she took\n",
      "courage, and told him of Aladdin's love for the Princess, and of his bold request, \"He sends\n",
      "you this gift,\" she continued, and opening the bundle she presented the magic fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cry of wonder went up from all those who stood around, for never had they beheld such exquisite\n",
      "jewels before. They shone and sparkled with a thousand lights and colors, and dazzled the eyes\n",
      "that gazed upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan was astounded, and spoke to the Grand Vizier apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely it is fit that I should give my daughter to one who can present such a wondrous gift?\"\n",
      "he said....\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when three months were ended, Aladdin's mother again presented herself before the Sultan,\n",
      "and reminded him of his promise, that the Princess should wed her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I ever abide by my royal word,\" said the Sultan; \"but he who marries my daughter must first\n",
      "send me forty golden basins filled to the brim with precious stones. These basins must be carried\n",
      "by forty black slaves, each led by a white slave dressed as befits the servants of the Sultan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aladdin's mother returned home in great distress when she heard this, and told Aladdin what\n",
      "the Sultan had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, my son!\" she cried, \"thy hopes are ended.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so, mother,\" answered Aladdin. \"The Sultan shall not have long to wait for his answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he rubbed the magic lamp, and when the Genie appeared, he bade him provide the forty golden\n",
      "basins filled with jewels, and all the slaves which the Sultan had demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when this splendid procession passed through the streets on its way to the palace, all\n",
      "the people came out to see the sight, and stood amazed when they saw the golden basins filled\n",
      "with sparkling gems carried on the heads of the great black slaves. And when the palace was\n",
      "reached, and the slaves presented the jewels to the Sultan, he was so surprised and delighted\n",
      "that he was more than willing that Aladdin should marry the Princess at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go, fetch thy son,\" he said to Aladdin's mother, who was waiting near. \"Tell him that this\n",
      "day he shall wed my daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Aladdin heard the news he refused to hasten at once to the palace, as his mother advised.\n",
      "First he called the Genie, and told him to bring a scented bath, and a robe worked in gold,\n",
      "such as a King might wear. After this he called for forty slaves to attend him, and six to\n",
      "walk before his mother, and a horse more beautiful than the Sultan's, and lastly, for ten thousand\n",
      "pieces of gold put up in ten purses.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all these things were ready, and Aladdin was dressed in his royal robe, he set out for\n",
      "the palace. As he rode along on his beautiful horse, attended by his forty slaves, he scattered\n",
      "the golden pieces out of the ten purses among the crowd, and all the people shouted with joy\n",
      "and delight. No one knew that this was the idle boy who used to play about the streets but\n",
      "they thought he was some great foreign Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Aladdin arrived at the palace in great state, and when the Sultan had embraced him, he\n",
      "ordered that the wedding feast should be prepared at once, and that the marriage should take\n",
      "place that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so, your Majesty,\" said Aladdin; \"I will not marry the Princess until I have built a palace\n",
      "fit for the daughter of the Sultan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he returned home, and once more called up the Slave of the Lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Build me the fairest palace ever beheld by mortal eye,\" ordered Aladdin. \"Let it be built\n",
      "of marble and jasper and precious stones. In the midst I would have a great hall, whose walls\n",
      "shall be of gold and silver, lighted by four-and-twenty windows. These windows shall all be\n",
      "set with diamonds, rubies, and other precious stones, and one only shall be left unfinished.\n",
      "There must also be stables with horses, and slaves to serve in the palace. Begone, and do thy\n",
      "work quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo! in the morning when Aladdin looked out, there stood the most wonderful palace that\n",
      "ever was built. Its marble walls were flushed a delicate pink in the morning light, and the\n",
      "jewels flashed from every window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aladdin and his mother set off for the Sultan's palace, and the wedding took place that\n",
      "day. The Princess loved Aladdin as soon as she saw him, and great were the rejoicings throughout\n",
      "the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to visit the new palace, and when he entered the great\n",
      "hall, whose walls were of gold and silver and whose windows were set with jewels, he was filled\n",
      "with admiration and astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the wonder of the world,\" he cried. \"Never before have mortal eyes beheld such a beautiful\n",
      "palace. One thing alone surprises me. Why is there one window left unfinished?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" answered Aladdin, \"this has been done with a purpose, for I wished that thine\n",
      "own royal hand should have the honor of putting the finishing touch to my palace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan was so pleased when he heard this, that he sent at once for all the court jewelers\n",
      "and ordered them to finish the window like the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court jewelers worked for many days, and then sent to tell the Sultan that they had used\n",
      "up all the jewels they possessed, and still the window was not half finished. The Sultan commanded\n",
      "that his own jewels should be given to complete the work; even when these were used the window\n",
      "was not finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aladdin ordered the jewelers to stop their work, and to take back all the Sultan's jewels\n",
      "as well as their own. And that night he called up the Slave of the Lamp once more, and bade\n",
      "him finish the window. This was done before the morning, and great was the surprise of the\n",
      "Sultan and all his workmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aladdin did not grow proud of his great riches but was gentle and courteous to all, and\n",
      "kind to the poor, so that the people all loved him dearly. He fought and won many battles for\n",
      "the Sultan, and was the greatest favorite in the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far away in Africa there was trouble brewing for Aladdin. The wicked old Magician who had\n",
      "pretended to be Aladdin's uncle found out by his magic powers that the boy had not perished\n",
      "when he left him underground, but had somehow managed to escape and become rich and powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have discovered the secret of the lamp,\" shrieked the Magician, tearing his hair with\n",
      "rage. \"I will not rest day or night until I shall have found some way of taking it from him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he journeyed from Africa to China, and when he came to the city where Aladdin lived and\n",
      "saw the wonderful palace, he nearly choked with fury to see all its splendor and richness.\n",
      "Then he disguised himself as a merchant, and bought a number of copper lamps, and with these\n",
      "went from street to street, crying, \"New lamps for old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the people heard his cry, they crowded round him, laughing and jeering, for they\n",
      "thought he must be mad to make such an offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it happened that Aladdin was out hunting, and the Princess sat alone in the hall of the\n",
      "jeweled windows. When, therefore, she heard the noise that was going on in the street outside,\n",
      "she called to her slaves to ask what it meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently one of the slaves came back, laughing so much that she could hardly speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a curious old man who offers to give new lamps for old,\" she cried. \"Did any one ever\n",
      "hear before of such a strange way of trading?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Princess laughed too, and pointed to an old lamp which hung in a niche close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is an old enough lamp,\" she said. \"Take it and see if the old man will really give a\n",
      "new one for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The slave took it down and ran out to the street once more, and when the Magician saw that\n",
      "it was indeed what he wanted, he seized the Magic Lamp with both his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Choose any lamp you like,\" he said, showing her those of bright new copper. He did not care\n",
      "now what happened. She might have all the new lamps if she wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went a little way outside the city, and when he was quite alone he took out the Magic\n",
      "Lamp and rubbed it gently. Immediately the Genie stood before him and asked what was his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I order thee to carry off the palace of Aladdin, with the Princess inside, and set it down\n",
      "in a lonely spot in Africa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And in an instant the palace, with every one in it, had disappeared, and when the Sultan happened\n",
      "to look out of his window, lo! there was no longer a palace to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must be enchantment,\" he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he ordered his men to set out and bring Aladdin to him in chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officers met Aladdin as he was returning from the hunt, and they immediately seized him,\n",
      "loaded him with chains, and carried him off to the Sultan. But as he was borne along, the people\n",
      "gathered around him, for they loved him dearly, and vowed that no harm should befall him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan was beside himself with rage when he saw Aladdin, and gave orders that his head\n",
      "should be cut off at once. But the people had begun to crowd into the palace, and they were\n",
      "so fierce and threatening that he dared not do as he wished. He was obliged to order the chains\n",
      "to be taken off, and Aladdin to be set free.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Aladdin was allowed to speak he asked why all this was done to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wretch!\" exclaimed the Sultan, \"come hither, and I will show thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he led Aladdin to the window and showed him the empty space where his palace had once stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think not that I care for thy vanished palace,\" he said. \"But where is the Princess, my daughter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So astonished was Aladdin that for some time he could only stand speechless, staring at the\n",
      "place where his palace ought to have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he turned to the Sultan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"grant me grace for one month, and if by that time I have not brought\n",
      "back thy daughter to thee, then put me to death as I deserve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aladdin was set free, and for three days he went about like a madman, asking every one he\n",
      "met where his palace was. But no one could tell him, and all laughed at his misery. Then he\n",
      "went to the river to drown himself; but as he knelt on the bank and clasped his hands to say\n",
      "his prayers before throwing himself in, he once more rubbed the Magic Ring. Instantly the Genie\n",
      "of the Ring stood before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is thy will, O master?\" it asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring back my Princess and my palace,\" cried Aladdin, \"and save my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I cannot do,\" said the Slave of the Ring. \"Only the Slave of the Lamp has power to bring\n",
      "back thy palace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then take me to the place where my palace now stands,\" said Aladdin, \"and put me down beneath\n",
      "the window of the Princess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And almost before Aladdin had done speaking he found himself in Africa, beneath the windows\n",
      "of his own palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so weary that he lay down and fell fast asleep; but before long, when day dawned, he\n",
      "was awakened by the song of the birds, and as he looked around his courage returned. He was\n",
      "now sure that all his misfortunes must have been caused by the loss of the Magic Lamp, and\n",
      "he determined to find out as soon as possible who had stolen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That same morning the Princess awoke feeling happier than she had felt since she had been carried\n",
      "off. The sun was shining so brightly, and the birds were singing so gaily, that she went to\n",
      "the window to greet the opening day. And who should she see standing beneath her window but\n",
      "Aladdin!\n",
      "\n",
      "With a cry of joy she threw open the casement and the sound made Aladdin look up. It was not\n",
      "long before he made his way through a secret door and held her in his arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, Princess,\" said Aladdin, when they had joyfully embraced each other many times, \"what\n",
      "has become of the old lamp which hung in a niche of the great hall?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas! my husband,\" answered the Princess, \"I fear my carelessness has been the cause of all\n",
      "our misfortunes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told him how the wicked old Magician had pretended to be a merchant, and had offered\n",
      "new lamps for old, and how he had thus managed to secure the Magic Lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has it still,\" she added, \"for I know that he carries it always, hidden in his robe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Princess,\" said Aladdin, \"I must recover this lamp, and thou shalt help me. To-night when\n",
      "the Magician dines with thee, dress thyself in thy costliest robes, and be kind and gracious\n",
      "to him. Then bid him fetch some of the wines of Africa, and when he is gone, I will tell thee\n",
      "what thou shalt do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So that night the Princess put on her most beautiful robes, and looked so lovely and was so\n",
      "kind when the Magician came in, that he could scarcely believe his eyes. For she had been sad\n",
      "and angry ever since he had carried her off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe now that Aladdin must be dead,\" she said, \"and I have made up my mind to mourn no\n",
      "longer. Let us begin our feast. But see! I grow weary of these wines of China, fetch me instead\n",
      "the wine of thy own country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aladdin had meanwhile prepared a powder which he directed the Princess to place in her\n",
      "own wine-cup. So when the Magician returned with the African wine, she filled her cup and offered\n",
      "it to him in token of friendship. The Magician drank it up eagerly, and scarcely had he finished\n",
      "when he dropped down dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aladdin came out of the next chamber where he had hidden himself, and searched in the\n",
      "Magician's robe until he found the Magic Lamp. He rubbed it joyfully, and when the Genie appeared,\n",
      "ordered that the palace should be carried back to China, and set down in its own place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following morning, when the Sultan rose early, for he was too sad to take much rest, he\n",
      "went to the window to gaze on the place where Aladdin's palace had once stood. He rubbed his\n",
      "eyes, and stared wildly about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must be a dream,\" he cried, for there stood the palace in all its beauty, looking fairer\n",
      "than ever in the morning light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a moment did the Sultan lose, but he rode over to the palace at once, and when he had embraced\n",
      "Aladdin and his daughter, they told him the whole story of the African Magician. Then Aladdin\n",
      "showed him the dead body of the wicked old man, and there was peace between them once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was still trouble in store for Aladdin. The African Magician had a younger brother\n",
      "who also dealt in magic, and who was if possible even more wicked than his elder brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of revenge, this younger brother started for China, determined to punish Aladdin and steal\n",
      "the Magic Lamp for himself. As soon as he arrived he went in secret to the cell of a holy woman\n",
      "called Fatima, and obliged her to give him her robe and veil as a disguise. Then to keep the\n",
      "secret safe he killed the poor woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressed in the robe and veil, the wicked Magician walked through the streets near Aladdin's\n",
      "palace, and all the people as he passed by knelt and kissed his robe, for they thought he was\n",
      "indeed the holy woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Princess heard that Fatima was passing by in the street, she sent and commanded\n",
      "her to be brought into the hall, and she treated the supposed holy woman with great respect\n",
      "and kindness, for she had often longed to see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not this a fine hall?\" she asked, as they sat together in the hall of the jeweled windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is indeed most beautiful,\" answered the Magician, who kept his veil carefully down, \"but\n",
      "to my mind there is one thing wanting. If only thou couldst have a roc's egg hung in the dome\n",
      "it would be perfect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Princess heard these words she became discontented and miserable, and when Aladdin\n",
      "came in, she looked so sad that he at once asked what was the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can never be happy until I have a roc's egg hanging from the dome of the great hall,\" she\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case thou shalt soon be happy,\" said Aladdin gaily, and taking down the lamp, he summoned\n",
      "the Genie.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the Slave of the Lamp heard the order his face grew terrible with rage, and his eyes\n",
      "gleamed like burning coals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vile wretch!\" he shrieked, \"have I not given thee all thy wishes, and now dost thou ask me\n",
      "to kill my master, and hang him as an ornament in thy palace? Thou deservest truly to die;\n",
      "but I know that the request cometh not from thine own heart, but was the suggestion of that\n",
      "wicked Magician who pretends to be a holy woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words the Genie vanished, and. Aladdin went at once to the room where the Princess\n",
      "was awaiting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a headache,\" he said. \"Call the holy woman, that she may place her hand upon my forehead\n",
      "and ease the pain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the moment that the false Fatima appeared Aladdin sprang up and plunged his dagger into\n",
      "that evil heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What hast thou done?\" cried the Princess. \"Alas! thou hast slain the holy woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is no holy woman,\" answered Aladdin, \"but an evil Magician whose purpose was to destroy\n",
      "us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aladdin was saved from the wicked design of the two Magicians, and there was no one left\n",
      "to disturb his peace. He and the Princess lived together in great happiness for many years,\n",
      "and when the Sultan died they succeeded to the throne, and ruled both wisely and well. And\n",
      "so there was great peace throughout the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "THE ENCHANTED HORSE\n",
      "\n",
      "It was New Year's day in Persia, the most splendid feast-day of all the year, and the King\n",
      "had been entertained, hour after hour, by the wonderful shows prepared for him by his people.\n",
      "Evening was drawing on and the court was just about to retire, when an Indian appeared, leading\n",
      "a horse which he wished to show to the King. It was not a real horse, but it was so wonderfully\n",
      "made that it looked exactly as if it were alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" cried the Indian, as he bowed himself to the ground, \"I beg thou wilt look\n",
      "upon this wonder. Nothing thou hast seen to-day can equal this horse of mine. I have only to\n",
      "mount upon its back and wish myself in any part of the world, and it carries me there in a\n",
      "few minutes.\" Now the King of Persia was very fond of curious and clever things, so he looked\n",
      "at the horse with great interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems only a common horse,\" he said, \"but thou shalt show us what it can do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he pointed to a distant mountain, and bade the Indian to fetch a branch from the palm-trees\n",
      "which grew near its foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indian vaulted into the saddle, turned a little peg in the horse's neck, and in a moment\n",
      "was flying so swiftly through the air that he soon disappeared from sight. In less than a quarter\n",
      "of an hour he reappeared, and laid the palm-branch at the King's feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art right,\" cried the King; \"thy enchanted horse is the most wonderful thing I have yet\n",
      "seen. What is its price? I must have it for my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indian shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"this horse can never be sold for money, but can only be exchanged\n",
      "for something of equal value. It shall be thine only if thou wilt give me instead the Princess,\n",
      "your daughter, for my wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words the King's son sprang to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sire,\" he cried, \"thou wilt never dream of granting such a request.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My son,\" answered the King, \"at whatever cost I must have this wonderful horse. But before\n",
      "I agree to the exchange, I would wish thee to try the horse, and tell me what thou thinkest of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indian, who stood listening to what they said, was quite willing that the Prince should\n",
      "try the Enchanted Horse, and began to give him directions how to guide it. But as soon as the\n",
      "Prince was in the saddle and saw the peg which made the horse start, he never waited to hear\n",
      "more. He turned the screw at once, and went flying off through the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" cried the Indian, \"he has gone off without learning how to come back. Never will he\n",
      "be able to stop the horse unless he finds the second peg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The King was terribly frightened when he heard the Indian's words, for, by this time, the Prince\n",
      "had disappeared from sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wretch,\" he cried, \"thou shalt be cast into prison, and unless my son returns in safety, thou\n",
      "shalt be put to death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the Prince had gone gaily sailing up into the air until he reached the clouds, and\n",
      "could no longer see the earth below. This was very pleasant, and he felt that he had never\n",
      "had such a delicious ride in his life before. But presently he began to think it was time to\n",
      "descend. He screwed the peg round and round, backwards and forwards, but it seemed to make\n",
      "no difference. Instead of coming down he sailed higher and higher, until he thought he was\n",
      "going to knock his head against the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was to be done? The Prince began to grow a little nervous, and he felt over the horse's\n",
      "neck to see if there was another peg to be found anywhere. To his joy, just behind the ear.\n",
      "He touched a small screw, and when he turned it, he felt he was going slower and slower, and\n",
      "gently turning round. Then he shouted with joy as the Enchanted Horse flew downwards through\n",
      "the starry night, and he saw, stretched out before him, a beautiful city gleaming white through\n",
      "the purple mantle of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was strange to him, and he did not know in what direction to guide the horse, so\n",
      "he let it go where it would, and presently it stopped on the roof of a great marble palace.\n",
      "There was a gallery running round the roof, and at the end of the gallery there was a door\n",
      "leading down some white marble steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince began at once to descend the steps, and found himself in a great hall where a row\n",
      "of black slaves were sleeping soundly, guarding the entrance to a room beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very softly the Prince crept past the guards, and lifting the curtain from the door, looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there he saw a splendid room lighted by a thousand lights and filled with sleeping slaves,\n",
      "and in the middle, upon a sofa, was the most beautiful Princess his eyes had ever gazed upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so lovely that the Prince held his breath with admiration as he looked at her. Then\n",
      "he went softly to her side, and, kneeling by the sofa, gently touched her hand. The Princess\n",
      "sighed and opened her eyes, but before she could cry out, he begged her in a whisper to be\n",
      "silent and fear nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a Prince,\" he said, \"the son of the King of Persia. I am in danger of my life here, and\n",
      "crave thy protection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this Princess was no other than the daughter of the King of Bengal, who happened to be\n",
      "staying alone in her summer palace outside the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will protect thee,\" said the Princess kindly, giving him her hand. Then she awoke her slaves\n",
      "and bade them give the stranger food and prepare a sleeping-room for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I long to hear thy adventures and how thou camest here,\" she said to the Prince, \"but first\n",
      "thou must rest and refresh thyself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never before had the Princess seen any one so gallant and handsome as this strange young Prince.\n",
      "She dressed herself in her loveliest robes, and twined her hair with her most precious jewels,\n",
      "that she might appear as beautiful as possible in his eyes. And when the Prince saw her again,\n",
      "he thought her the most charming Princess in all the world, and he loved her with all his heart.\n",
      "But when he had told her all his adventures she sighed to think that he must now leave her\n",
      "and return to his father's court.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not grieve,\" he said, \"I will return in state as befits a Prince, and demand thy hand in\n",
      "marriage from the King thy father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay but a few days ere thou goest,\" replied the Princess. \"I cannot part with thee so soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince was only too willing to wait a while, and the Princess entertained him so well with\n",
      "feasts and hunting-parties that day after day slipped by, and still he lingered.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, the thought of his home and his father's grief made him decide to return at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Princess,\" he said, \"since it is so hard to part, wilt thou not ride with me upon the Enchanted\n",
      "Horse? When we are once more in Persia our marriage shall take place, and then we will return\n",
      "to the King thy father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So together they mounted the Enchanted Horse and the Prince placed his arm around the Princess\n",
      "and turned the magic peg. Up and up they flew over land and sea, and then the Prince turned\n",
      "the other screw, and they landed just outside his father's city. He guided the horse to a palace\n",
      "outside the gates, and there he left the Princess, for he wished to go alone to prepare his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the Prince reached the court he found every one dressed in brown, and all the bells\n",
      "of the city were tolling mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is every one so sad?\" he asked of one of the guards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Prince, the Prince!\" cried the man. \"The Prince has come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And soon the joyful news spread over the town, and the bells stopped tolling and rang a joyful\n",
      "peal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My beloved son!\" cried the King, as he embraced him. \"We thought thou wert lost for ever,\n",
      "and we have mourned for thee day and night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without waiting to hear more, the Prince began to tell the King all his adventures, and how\n",
      "the Princess of Bengal awaited him in the palace outside the gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let her be brought here instantly,\" cried the King, \"and the marriage shall take place to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he ordered that the Indian should be set free at once and allowed to depart with the Enchanted\n",
      "Horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the surprise of the Indian when, instead of having his head cut off as he had expected,\n",
      "he was allowed to go free with his wonderful horse. He asked what adventures had befallen the\n",
      "Prince, and when he heard of the Princess who was waiting in the palace outside the gates,\n",
      "a wicked plan came into his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the Enchanted Horse, and went straight to the palace before the King's messengers could\n",
      "reach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell the Princess,\" he said to the slaves, \"that the Prince of Persia has sent me to bring\n",
      "her to his father's palace upon the Enchanted Horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Princess was very glad when she heard this message, and she quickly made herself ready\n",
      "to go with the messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But alas! as soon as the Indian turned the peg and the horse flew through the air, she found\n",
      "she was being carried off, far away from Persia and her beloved Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "All her prayers and entreaties were in vain. The Indian only mocked at her, and told her he\n",
      "meant to marry her himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the Prince and his attendants had arrived at the palace outside the gates, only to\n",
      "find that the Indian had been there before them and had carried off the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince was nearly beside himself with grief, but he still hoped to find his bride. He disguised\n",
      "himself as a dervish and set off to seek for her, vowing that he would find her, or perish\n",
      "in the attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the Enchanted Horse had traveled many hundreds of miles. Then, as the Indian was\n",
      "hungry, it was made to descend into a wood close to a town of Cashmere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Indian went in search of food, and when he returned with some fruit he shared it with\n",
      "the Princess, who was faint and weary.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Princess had eaten a little she felt stronger and braver, and as she heard horses\n",
      "galloping past, she called out loudly for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men on horseback came riding at once to her aid, and she quickly told them who she was,\n",
      "and how the Indian had carried her off against her will. Then the leader of the horsemen, who\n",
      "was the Sultan of Cashmere, ordered his men to cut off the Indian's head. But he placed the\n",
      "Princess upon his horse and led her to his palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Princess thought that her troubles were all at an end, but she was much mistaken. The\n",
      "Sultan had no sooner seen her than he made up his mind to marry her, and he ordered the wedding\n",
      "preparations to be begun without loss of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain the Princess begged to be sent back to Persia. The Sultan only smiled and fixed the\n",
      "wedding-day. Then when she saw that nothing would turn him from his purpose, she thought of\n",
      "a plan to save herself. She began talking all the nonsense she could think of and behaving\n",
      "as if she were mad, and so well did she pretend, that the wedding was put off, and all the\n",
      "doctors were called in to see if they could cure her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whenever a doctor came near the Princess she became so wild and violent that he dared not\n",
      "even feel her pulse, so none of them discovered that she was only pretending.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan was in great distress, and sent far and near for the cleverest doctors. But none\n",
      "of them seemed to be able to cure the Princess of her madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Prince of Persia was wandering about in search of his Princess, and when\n",
      "he came to one of the great cities of India, he heard every one talking about the sad illness\n",
      "of the Princess of Bengal who was to have married the Sultan. He at once disguised himself\n",
      "as a doctor and went to the palace, saying he had come to cure the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan received the new doctor with joy, and led him at once to the room where the Princess\n",
      "sat alone, weeping and wringing her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" said the disguised Prince, \"no one else must enter the room with me, or the\n",
      "cure will fail.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Sultan left him, and the Prince went close to the Princess, and gently touched her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My beloved Princess,\" he said, \"dost thou not know me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Princess heard that dear voice she threw herself into the Prince's arms, and\n",
      "her joy was so great that she could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must at once plan our escape,\" said the Prince. \"Canst thou tell me what has become of\n",
      "the Enchanted Horse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naught can I tell thee of it, dear Prince,\" answered the Princess, \"but since the Sultan knows\n",
      "its value, no doubt he has kept it in some safe place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then first we must persuade the Sultan that thou art almost cured,\" said the Prince. \"Put\n",
      "on thy costliest robes and dine with him to-night, and I will do the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan was charmed to find the Princess so much better, and his joy knew no bounds when\n",
      "the new doctor told him that he hoped by the next day to complete the cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I find that the Princess has somehow been infected by the magic of the Enchanted Horse,\" he\n",
      "said. \"If thou wilt have the horse brought out into the great square, and place the Princess\n",
      "upon its back, I will prepare some magic perfumes which will dispel the enchantment. Let all\n",
      "the people be gathered together to see the sight, and let the Princess be arrayed in her richest\n",
      "dress and decked with all her jewels.\"\n",

      "So next morning the Enchanted Horse was brought out into the crowded square, and the Princess\n",
      "was mounted upon its back. Then the disguised Prince placed four braziers of burning coals\n",
      "round the horse and threw into them a perfume of a most delicious scent. The smoke of the perfume\n",
      "rose in thick clouds, almost hiding the Princess, and at that moment the Prince leaped into\n",
      "the saddle behind her, turned the peg, and sailed away into the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he swept past the Sultan, he cried aloud, \"Sultan of Cashmere, next time thou dost wish\n",
      "to wed a Princess, ask her first if she be willing to wed thee.\"\n",

      "So this was the manner in which the Prince of Persia carried off the Princess of Bengal for\n",

      "SINDBAD THE SAILOR\n",
      "\n",
      "In the city of Bagdad, far away in Persia, there lived a poor man called Hindbad. He was a\n",
      "porter, and one hot afternoon, as he was carrying a very heavy load, he stopped to rest in\n",
      "a quiet street near a beautiful house which he had never seen before. The pavement outside\n",
      "was sprinkled with rose-water, which felt very cool and pleasant to his hot, weary feet, and\n",
      "from the open windows came the most delicious scents which perfumed all the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hindbad wondered who lived in this beautiful house, and presently he went up to one of the\n",
      "splendidly dressed servants, who was standing at the door, and asked to whom it belonged. The\n",
      "servant stared in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thou indeed live in Bagdad and knowest not my master's name?\" he said. \"He is the great\n",
      "Sindbad the Sailor, the man who has sailed all round the world, and who has had the most wonderful\n",
      "adventures under the sun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Hindbad had often heard of this wonderful man and of his great riches, and as he looked\n",
      "at the beautiful palace and saw the splendidly dressed servants it made him feel sad and envious.\n",
      "As he turned away sighing, to take up his load again, he looked up into the blue sky, and said\n",
      "aloud:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a difference there is between this man's lot and mine. He has all that he wants, and\n",
      "nothing to do but to spend money and enjoy a pleasant life, while I have to work hard to get\n",
      "dry bread enough to keep myself and my children alive. What has he done that he should be so\n",
      "lucky, and what have I done that I should be so miserable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then one of the servants touched him on the shoulder, and said to him: \"My noble master\n",
      "wishes to see thee, and has bidden me fetch thee to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor porter was frightened at first, for he thought some one might have overheard what\n",
      "he had been saying, but the servant took his arm and led him into the great dining-hall. There\n",
      "were many guests seated round the table, on which was spread a most delicious feast, and at\n",
      "the head of the table sat a grave, stately old man with a long white beard. This was Sindbad\n",
      "the Sailor. He smiled kindly on poor frightened Hindbad, and made a sign that he should come\n",
      "and sit at his right hand. Then all the most delicious things on the table were offered by\n",
      "the servants to Hindbad, and his glass was filled with the choicest wine, so that he began\n",
      "to feel it must all be a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the feast was over Sindbad turned to him and asked him what it was he had been saying\n",
      "outside the window just before he came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hindbad was very much ashamed, and hung his head as he answered: \"My lord, I was tired\n",
      "and ill-tempered, and I said foolish words, which I trust thou wilt now pardon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" replied Sindbad, \"I am not so unjust as to blame thee. I am indeed only sorry for thee.\n",
      "But thou wert wrong in thinking that I have always led an easy life, and that these riches\n",
      "came to me without trouble or suffering. I have won them by years of toil and danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then turning to his other guests he said, \"Yes, my friends, the tale of my adventures is enough\n",
      "to warn every one of you never to go in search of wealth. I have never told you the story of\n",
      "my voyages, but if you will listen I will begin this very night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the servants were ordered to carry home the porter's load, that he might stay in Sindbad's\n",
      "palace that evening and listen to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father left me a great deal of money when I was a young man, but I spent it so quickly\n",
      "and foolishly that I began to see it would soon all be gone. This made me stop and think, for\n",
      "I did not like the idea of being poor. So I counted up all the money that remained, and made\n",
      "up my mind that I would trade with it. I joined a company of merchants, and we set sail in\n",
      "a good ship, meaning to go from place to place, and sell or exchange our goods at whatever\n",
      "towns we stopped. And so began my first voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the first few days I could think of nothing but the heaving of the waves; but by and by\n",
      "I began to feel better, and never again was I at all unhappy upon the sea. One afternoon, when\n",
      "the wind had suddenly dropped and we were lying becalmed, we found ourselves near a little\n",
      "low green island, which looked like a meadow, and only just showed above the sea. The captain\n",
      "of the ship gave us permission to land, and presently we were all enjoying ourselves on the\n",
      "green meadow. We walked about for some time and then sat down to rest, and some of us set to\n",
      "work to light a fire, that we might make our evening meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But scarcely had the fire begun to burn, when we heard loud shouts from the ship warning us\n",
      "to come back at once, for what we had taken to be an island was indeed the back of a sleeping\n",
      "whale. My companions all rushed to the boats, but before I could follow them the great monster\n",
      "dived down and disappeared, leaving me struggling in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I clung to a piece of wood which we had brought from the ship to make the fire, and I could\n",
      "only hope that I would soon be picked up by my companions. But alas! there was so much confusion\n",
      "on board that no one missed me, and as a wind sprang up the captain set sail, and I was left\n",
      "alone at the mercy of the waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All night long I floated, and when morning came I was so tired and weak that I thought I must\n",
      "die. But just then a great wave lifted me up and threw me against the steep side of an island,\n",
      "and to my joy I managed to climb the cliff and rest on the green grass above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Soon I began to feel better, and as I was very hungry I went to look for something to eat.\n",
      "I found some plants which tasted good, and a spring of clear water, and having made a good\n",
      "meal, I walked about the island to see what I would find next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before long I came to a great meadow where a horse was tied, and as I stood looking at it,\n",
      "I heard men's voices which sounded as if they came from under the earth. Then from an underground\n",
      "cave a man appeared, who asked me who I was and where I came from. He took me into the cave\n",
      "where his companions were, and they told me they were the grooms belonging to the King of the\n",
      "island, whose horses they brought to feed in the meadow. They gave me a good meal, and told\n",
      "me it was very lucky that I had come just then, for next day, they meant to return to their\n",
      "master, and would show me the way, which I could never have found for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we set off together early next morning, and when we reached the city I was very kindly\n",
      "received by the King. He listened to the story of my adventures, and then bade his servants\n",
      "see that I wanted for nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I was a merchant I took great interest in the shipping, and often went down to the quay\n",
      "to see the boats unload. One day when I was looking over a cargo which had just been landed,\n",
      "what was my astonishment to see a number of bales with my own name marked on them. I went at\n",
      "once to the captain and asked him who was the owner of these bales of goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Ah!' replied the captain, 'they belonged to a merchant of Bagdad called Sindbad. But he,\n",
      "alas! perished in a dreadful way soon after we sailed, for with a number of people belonging\n",
      "to my ship he landed on what looked like a green island, but which was really the back of a\n",
      "great sleeping whale. As soon as the monster felt the warmth of the fire which they had lighted\n",
      "on his back, he woke up and dived below the sea. Many of my men were drowned, and among them\n",
      "poor Sindbad. Now I mean to sell his goods that I may give the money to his relations when\n",
      "I find them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Captain,' said I, 'these bales are mine, for I am that Sindbad who thou sayest was drowned.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What wickedness there is in the world,' cried the captain. 'How canst thou pretend to be\n",
      "Sindbad when I saw him drowned before my eyes?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But presently, when I had told him all that had happened to me, and when the other merchants\n",
      "from the ship knew me to be the true Sindbad, he was overjoyed, and ordered that the bales\n",
      "should be at once given to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I was able to give the King a handsome present, and after I had traded with my goods for\n",
      "sandal-wood, nutmegs, ginger, pepper and cloves, I set sail once more with the kind old captain.\n",
      "On the way home I was able to sell all my spices at a good price, so that when I landed I found\n",
      "I had a hundred thousand sequins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My family were delighted to see me again, and I soon bought some land and built a splendid\n",
      "house, in which I meant to live happily and forget all the troubles through which I had passed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Sindbad ended the story of his first voyage. He ordered the music to strike up and the\n",
      "feast to go on, and when it was over he gave the poor porter Hindbad a hundred gold pieces\n",
      "and told him to come back at the same time next evening if he wished to hear the tale of the\n",
      "second voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hindbad went joyfully home, and you can imagine how happy the poor family were that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next evening he set out once more for Sindbad's house, dressed in his best clothes. There he\n",
      "enjoyed a splendid supper as before, and when it was over Sindbad said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was very happy for some time at home, but before long I began to grow weary of leading an\n",
      "idle life. I longed to be upon the sea again, to feel the good ship bounding over the waves,\n",
      "and to hear the wind whistling through the rigging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I set to work at once and bought all kinds of goods that I might sell again in foreign\n",
      "lands, and then, having found a suitable ship, I set sail with other merchants, and so began\n",
      "my second voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We stopped at many places, and sold our goods at a great profit, and all went well until one\n",
      "day when we landed on a new island. It was a most beautiful place, fair as the garden of Eden,\n",
      "where exquisite flowers made a perfect rainbow of color and delicious fruits hung in ripe clusters\n",
      "above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, under the shadow of the tree, I sat down to rest and to feast my eyes upon all the loveliness\n",
      "around. I ate the food I had brought with me, drank my wine, and then closed my eyes. The soft\n",
      "music of the stream which flowed close by was like a song in my ears, and, before I knew what\n",
      "I was doing, I fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot tell how long I slept, but when at last I opened my eyes, I could not see my companions\n",
      "anywhere, and when I looked towards the sea, to my horror I found the ship was gone. It was\n",
      "sailing away, a white speck in the distance, and here was I, left alone upon this desert island.\n",
      "I cried aloud and wrung my hands with grief, and wished with all my heart that I had stayed\n",
      "safely at home. But what was the use of wishing that now?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I climbed into a high tree, and looked around to see if I could by any means find a way\n",
      "of escape from the island. First I looked towards the sea, but there was no hope for me there,\n",
      "and then I turned and looked inland. The first thing that caught my eye was a huge white dome,\n",
      "that seemed to rise from the center of the island, unlike anything I had ever seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I climbed down the tree, and made my way towards the white dome as quickly as I could, but\n",
      "when I reached it, it puzzled me more than ever. It was like a great smooth ball, much too\n",
      "slippery to climb, and into it there was no door or entrance of any sort. I walked round and\n",
      "round it, wondering what it could be, when suddenly a dark shadow fell upon everything and\n",
      "it grew black as night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I gazed upwards in great fear, and knew that the shadow was cast by a great bird with outspread\n",
      "wings hovering over the place where I stood and shutting out heaven's light. As I looked, it\n",
      "suddenly came swooping down, and sat upon the white dome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it flashed into my mind that this must be the bird which I had heard sailors talk of,\n",
      "called a roc, and the smooth white ball must be its egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick as thought, I unbound my turban, and twisted it into a rope. Then I wound it round and\n",
      "round my waist, and tied the two ends tightly round the roc's leg, which was close to where\n",
      "I stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'It will fly away soon, and carry me away with it off this desert island,' I said to myself\n",
      "joyfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And sure enough, before very long I felt myself lifted off the ground, and carried up and\n",
      "up until it seemed as if we had reached the clouds. Then the huge bird began to sink down again,\n",
      "and when it reached the ground I quickly untied my turban, and set myself free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was so small, compared to the roc, that it had never even noticed me, but darted off towards\n",
      "a great black object lying near, which it seized with its beak and carried off. Imagine my\n",
      "horror when I looked again and saw other dark objects, and discovered that they were great\n",
      "black snakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here was I, in a deep valley, with mountains rising sheer up on every side, and nothing to\n",
      "be seen among the rocks but those terrible black snakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Oh!' I cried, 'why did I ever try to leave the desert island? I have indeed only come into\n",
      "worse misfortune.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I looked around, I noticed that the ground was strewn with sparkling stones, which seemed\n",
      "to quiver with light, and when I looked nearer, I found they were diamonds of extraordinary\n",
      "size, although lying about like common pebbles. At first I was delighted, but they soon ceased\n",
      "to please me, for I feared each moment I might be seized by one of the terrible snakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These snakes were so large that they could easily have swallowed an elephant, and although\n",
      "they lay quiet during the day, and hid themselves for fear of the roc, at night they came out\n",
      "in search of food. I managed to find a cave among the rocks before nightfall, and there I sat\n",
      "in fear and trembling until morning, when I once more went out into the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I sat thinking what I should do next, I saw a great piece of raw meat come bounding down\n",
      "into the valley, from rock to rock. Then another piece followed, and another, until several\n",
      "large pieces lay at my feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I remembered a tale which travelers had told me about the famous Diamond Valley. They\n",
      "said that every year, when the young eagles were hatched, merchants went to the heights above,\n",
      "and rolled down great pieces of raw meat into the valley. The diamonds on which the meat fell\n",
      "would often stick into the soft flesh, and then when the eagles came, and carried off the meat\n",
      "to feed their young ones, the merchants would beat them off their nests, and take the diamonds\n",
      "out of the meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had never believed this wonderful tale, but now indeed I knew it to be true, and felt sure\n",
      "that I was in the famous Diamond Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had quite given up all hope of escape, for there was no possible way of climbing out of\n",
      "the valley, but as I watched the eagles carry off the lumps of raw meat, I thought of a plan,\n",
      "and hope revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First of all I searched around, and filled all my pockets with the biggest diamonds I could\n",
      "find. Then I chose out the largest piece of meat and fastened myself securely to it, with the\n",
      "rope made out of my turban. I knew that the eagles would soon come for more food, so I lay\n",
      "flat on the ground, with the meat uppermost, and holding on tightly, I waited for what would\n",
      "happen next. I had not long to wait before a gigantic eagle came swooping down. It seized the\n",
      "meat and carried it and me swiftly up, until it reached its nest high among the mountain rocks.\n",
      "And no sooner had it dropped me into the nest, than a man climbed out from behind the rock,\n",
      "and with loud cries frightened the eagle away. Then this man, who was the merchant to whom\n",
      "the nest belonged, came eagerly to look for his piece of meat. When he saw me, he started back\n",
      "in surprise and anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What doest thou here?' he asked roughly. 'How dost thou dare to try and steal my diamonds?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Have patience,' I answered calmly, 'I am no thief, and when thou hast heard my story thou\n",
      "wilt pity and not blame me. As for diamonds, I have some here which will more than make up\n",
      "to thee for thy disappointment.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I told him and the other merchants all my adventures, and they cast up their eyes to\n",
      "heaven in surprise at my courage, and the wonderful manner in which I had managed to escape\n",
      "so many dangers. Pulling out a handful of diamonds, I then passed the precious stones round\n",
      "among them, and they all declared them to be the finest they had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Thou shalt choose one, to make up for thy disappointment,' I said to the merchant who had\n",
      "found me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I will choose this small one,' he replied, picking out one of the least of the glistening heap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I urged him to take a larger one, but he only shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'This one will bring me all the wealth I can desire,' he said, 'and I need no longer risk\n",
      "my life seeking for more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we all set off for the nearest port, where we found a ship ready to carry us home. We\n",
      "had many adventures on the way, but at last we reached our journey's end, and when I had sold\n",
      "my diamonds, I had so much money that I gave a great deal to the poor, and lived in even greater\n",
      "splendor than before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Sindbad paused, and ordered that another hundred gold pieces should be given to Hindbad,\n",
      "and that he should depart. But next evening when the guests had all assembled and Hindbad had\n",
      "also returned, Sindbad began once more to tell them a story of his adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This time,\" began Sindbad, \"I stayed at home for the space of a whole year, and then I prepared\n",
      "to set out on another voyage. My friends and relations did all in their power to prevent my\n",
      "going, but I could not be persuaded, and before long I set sail in a ship which was about to\n",
      "make a very long voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing went well with us from the beginning. We were driven out of our course by storms and\n",
      "tempests, and the captain and pilot knew not where we were. When at last they found out in\n",
      "which direction we had drifted, things seemed in a worse state than ever. We were alarmed to\n",
      "see the captain suddenly pull off his turban, tear the hair from his beard, and beat his head\n",
      "as if he were mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What is the matter?' we asked, gathering round him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Alas!' he cried, 'we are lost. The ship is now caught in a dangerous current from which nothing\n",
      "can save her and us. In a very few moments we shall all be dashed to pieces.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No sooner had he spoken than the ship was carried along at a tremendous speed straight on\n",
      "to a rocky shore which lay at the foot of a steep mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But although the ship was dashed to pieces, we all managed to escape, and were thrown with\n",
      "our goods and some provisions high on to the rocky strip of shore. Here we found the scattered\n",
      "remains of many wrecks, and quantities of bones bleached white in the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'We may prepare ourselves for death,' said the captain mournfully. 'No man has ever escaped\n",
      "from this shore, for it is impossible to climb the mountain behind us, and no ship dare approach\n",
      "to save us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But nevertheless he divided the provisions among us, that we might live as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thing that surprised me greatly was a river of fresh water which flowed out of the mountain,\n",
      "and, instead of running into the sea, disappeared into a rocky cavern on the other side of\n",
      "the shore. As I gazed into the mouth of this cavern I saw that it was lined with sparkling\n",
      "gems, and that the bed of the river was studded with rubies and diamonds and all manner of\n",
      "precious stones. Great quantities of these were also scattered around, and treasures from the\n",
      "wrecked ships lay in every corner of the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One by one my companions died as they came to the end of their food, and one by one I buried\n",
      "them, until at last I was left quite alone. I was able to live on very little, and so my food\n",
      "had lasted longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Woe is me!' I cried, 'who shall bury me when I die? Why, oh! why was I not content to remain\n",
      "safe and happy at home?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I bemoaned my evil fate I wandered to the banks of the river, and as I watched it disappear\n",
      "into the rocky cave a happy thought came to me. Surely if this stream entered the mountain\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Eagerly I began to make a strong raft of the wood and planks which were scattered all over\n",
      "the shore. Then I collected as many diamonds and rubies and as much wrecked treasure as my\n",
      "raft would hold, and took my last little store of food. I launched the raft with great care,\n",
      "and soon found myself floating swiftly along until I disappeared into the dark passage of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"On and on I went through the thick darkness, the passage seeming to grow smaller and narrower\n",
      "until I was obliged to lie flat on the raft for fear of striking my head. My food was now all\n",
      "gone, and I gave myself up for lost, and then mercifully I fell into a deep sleep which must\n",
      "have lasted many hours. I was awakened by the sound of strange voices, and jumping up, what\n",
      "was my joy to find I was once more in heaven's sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The river was flowing gently through a green, pleasant land, and the sounds I had heard were\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I could not understand the language these negroes spoke, until at last one of their number\n",
      "began to speak to me in Arabic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peace be to thee!' he said. 'Who art thou, and whence hast thou come? We are the people of\n",

      "us, then, how thou hast come to this place.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I pray thee, by Allah.\" I cried, 'give me food, and then I will tell thee all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then the men gave me food, and I ate until my strength returned and my soul was refreshed,\n",

      "\"'We must take him to the King,' they cried with one voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then they told me that the King of Serendib was the richest and greatest king on earth, and\n",
      "I went with them willingly, taking with me my bales and treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never had I seen such splendor and richness as at the court of the King of Serendib, and great\n",
      "was his kindness towards me. He listened to the tale of my adventures with interest, and when\n",
      "I begged to be allowed to return home, he ordered that a ship should be made ready at once.\n",
      "Then he wrote a letter with his own hand to the Caliph, our sovereign lord, and loaded me with\n",
      "costly gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thus, when I arrived at Bagdad, I went at once to the court of the Caliph, and presented the\n",
      "letter and the gift which the King had sent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This gift was a cup made out of a single ruby lined inside with precious stones, also a skin\n",
      "of the serpent that swallows elephants, which had spots upon its back like pieces of gold,\n",
      "and which could cure all illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Caliph was delighted with the letter and the gift.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'O my Lord,' I said, 'no words can give you an idea of his riches. His throne is set upon\n",
      "a huge elephant and a thousand horsemen ride around him, clad in cloth of gold. His mace is\n",
      "of gold studded with emeralds, and indeed his splendor is as great as that of King Solomon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Caliph listened attentively to my words, and then, giving me a present, he allowed me\n",
      "to depart. I returned home swiftly to my family and friends, and when I had sold my treasures\n",
      "and given much to the poor, I lived in such peace and happiness that my evil adventures soon\n",
      "seemed like a far-off dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Sindbad finished the story, and bade his guests return the next evening as usual. And next\n",
      "day, when all the guests were once more seated at the table and had finished their feasting,\n",
      "Sindbad began the story of his last voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had now made up my mind that nothing would tempt me to leave my home again, and that I would\n",
      "seek for no more adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day, however, as I was feasting with my friends, one of my servants came to tell me that\n",
      "a messenger from the Caliph awaited my pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What is thy errand?' I asked when the messenger was presented to me.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Thus was I obliged to set out immediately for the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Sindbad,' said the Caliph, when I had bowed myself to the ground before him, 'I have need\n",
      "of thy services. I desire to send a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib, and thou shalt\n",
      "be the bearer of them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then indeed did my face fall, and I became pale as death.\n",
      "\n",

      "to leave my home again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I told him all my adventures, which caused him much astonishment. Nevertheless, he urged\n",
      "me to do as he wished, and seeing that there was no escape, I consented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I set sail at the Caliph's command, and after a good voyage I at last reached the island of\n",
      "Serendib, where I received a hearty welcome. I told the officers of the court what my errand\n",
      "was, and they led me to the palace, where I bowed myself to the ground before the great King.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Sindbad,' he said kindly, 'thou art welcome. I have often thought of thee, and wished to\n",
      "see thy face again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I presented the Caliph's letter, and the rich present he had sent, which pleased the King\n",
      "well. When a few days had passed, I begged to be allowed to depart, and after receiving many\n",
      "gifts I once more set sail for home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But alas! the return journey began badly. We had not sailed many days, when we were pursued\n",
      "by pirates, who captured the ship, and took prisoners all those who were not killed. I, among\n",
      "others, was carried ashore and sold by a pirate to a rich merchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What is thy trade?' asked the merchant when he had bought me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I am a merchant,' I answered, 'and know no trade.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Canst thou shoot with a bow and arrow?' asked my master.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This I said I could do, and putting one in my hand he led me out to a great forest and bade\n",
      "me climb into a high tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Watch there,' he said, 'until thou shalt see a herd of elephants pass by. Then try to shoot\n",
      "one, and if thou art fortunate, come at once and tell me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All night I watched, and saw nothing, but in the morning a great number of elephants came\n",
      "thundering by, and I shot several arrows among them. One big elephant fell to the ground, and\n",
      "lay there while the rest passed on; so, as soon as it was safe, I climbed down and carried\n",
      "the news to my master. Together we buried the huge animal and marked the place, so that we\n",
      "might return to fetch the tusks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I continued this work for some time, and killed many elephants, until one night I saw to my\n",
      "horror that the elephants, instead of passing on, had surrounded the tree in which I sat, and\n",
      "were stamping and trumpeting, until the very earth shook. Then one of them seized the tree\n",
      "with his trunk, and tore it up by the roots, laying it flat on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was almost senseless with terror, but the next moment I felt myself gently lifted up by\n",
      "an elephant's trunk, and placed on his back. I clung on with all my might, as the elephant\n",
      "carried me through the forest, until at last we came to the slope of a hill, which was covered\n",
      "with bleached bones and tusks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here the elephant gently laid me down, and left me alone. I gazed around on this great treasure\n",
      "of ivory, and I could not help wondering at the wisdom of these animals. They had evidently\n",
      "brought me here to show me that I could get ivory without killing any more of their number.\n",
      "For this, I felt sure, was the elephants' burying-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not stay long on the hill, but gathering a few tusks together I sped back to the town,\n",
      "that I might tell my tale to the merchant. 'My poor Sindbad,' he cried, when he saw me, I thought\n",
      "thou wert dead, for I found the uprooted tree, and never expected to look upon thy face again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great was his delight when I told him of the Hill of Ivory, and when we had gone there together,\n",
      "and he saw for himself the wonders I had described, he was filled with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Sindbad,' he cried, 'thou too shalt have a share of this great wealth. And first of all I\n",
      "shall give thee thy, freedom. Until now, year by year have all my slaves been killed by the\n",
      "elephants, but now we need no longer run any risks, for here is ivory enough to enrich the\n",
      "whole island.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I was set free, and loaded with honors, and when the trade winds brought the ships that\n",
      "traded in ivory, I bade good-by to the island, and set sail for home, carrying with me a great\n",
      "cargo of ivory and other treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As soon as I landed I went to the Caliph, who was overjoyed to see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Great has been my anxiety, O Sindbad,' he said, 'for I feared some evil had befallen thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When, therefore, I had told him of my adventures, he was the more astonished, and ordered\n",
      "that all my story should be written in letters of gold, and placed among his treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I returned to my own house, and ever since have remained at home in peace and safety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Sindbad finished the story of his voyages, and turning to Hindbad, he said: \"And now,\n",
      "friend Hindbad, what dost thou think of the way I have earned my riches? Is it not just that\n",
      "I should live in enjoyment and ease?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O my lord,\" cried Hindbad, bowing before Sindbad, and kissing his hand, \"great have been thy\n",

      "to thine. Long mayest thou live and prosper!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly through the dim woods he saw a light, as if the golden sun and silver moon shone both\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, lo! in the radiance of this light there stood before him the three fairest of the godesses--queenly\n",

      "\n",
      "Like music stealing through the trees came the soft voice of Hera:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of all mortal men thou art the most beautiful, Paris, and to thee do we come for judgment.\n",
      "Tell us which of us is the fairest of all, and to that one whom thou so deemest, give this\n",
      "golden apple.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Hera, and placed in the hand of Paris an apple of purest gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she spake: \"If to me, Hera, queen of goddesses, and wife of mighty Zeus, king of all\n",
      "the gods, thou dost grant the prize of loveliness, Power immeasurable shall be thine. King\n",
      "shalt thou be of the lands where the gray dawn rises, and king even to where the red sun goes\n",
      "down. A hundred peoples shall call thee lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent, and the voice of Athene, fair and pure as a silver moonbeam, broke the stillness\n",
      "of the starless night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To me award the prize,\" she said, \"and wise as the gods shalt thou be. With me as thy friend\n",
      "and guide, all things will be possible to thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Last of all, standing in a rosy light, as of the dawning sunlight in the spring, spoke Aphrodite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are Power and Wisdom, fair Paris?\" she pled. \"Wisdom and Power bring no joy at last.\n",
      "I will give thee Love, and for thy wife thou shalt have the fairest woman in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Paris, the melody of her voice still in his ears, as he gazed spellbound on her face of\n",
      "wondrous beauty, handed to Aphrodite the golden prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "So was it that the wrath of the gods came upon Paris, son of Priam. For Hera and Athene, filled\n",
      "with rage, vowed to be revenged upon Paris and all his race, and made all the gods pledge themselves\n",
      "to aid them in their vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across far seas sailed Paris, with Aphrodite as his guide, to Sparta, where Menelaus was king.\n",
      "\n",
      "A brave king was Menelaus, and happily he lived in his kingdom with Helen, his queen, fairest\n",
      "of all women. One child they had, a little maid, Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to Sparta there came Paris, with eyes blue as the sea, and hair that gleamed like gold\n",
      "on his purple robe, gallant and brave, and more beautiful than any mortal man, glad was the\n",
      "welcome that he had from Menelaus.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Paris gazed on Helen's face, he knew that in all the world there was no woman half\n",
      "so fair as the wife of Menelaus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Aphrodite cast her magic upon Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No longer did she love her husband, nor did she remember little Hermione, her own dear child.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Paris spoke to her words of love, and begged her to flee with him, and to be his wife,\n",
      "she knew only that she loved Paris more than all else. Gladly she went with him, and in his\n",
      "red-prowed ship together they sailed across the green waves to Troyland, where Mount Ida showed\n",
      "her snowy crown high above the forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "An angry man was Menelaus when he found that Paris had stolen from him the fair wife who was\n",
      "to him as his own heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his elder brother Agamemnon, overlord of all the Greeks, he went and told his grievous tale.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many were the heroes who sailed away from Greece to punish Paris and his kin, and to bring\n",
      "back fair Helen to her own land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few there were who came home, for ten long years of woe and of spilling of blood came to the\n",
      "men of Greece and of Troy from the fatal beauty of Helen the queen.\n",

      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "THE COUNCIL\n",
      "\n",
      "That night both gods and men slept long; only Zeus, king of the gods, lay wakeful, pondering\n",
      "in his heart how best he might do honor to Achilles. \"I shall send a Dream to beguile Agamemnon,\"\n",
      "at length he resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did he call to a Dream, for by Dreams the gods sent their messages to mortal men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go now, thou evil Dream,\" said Zeus, \"go to where Agamemnon sleeps in his tent near to his\n",
      "fleet ships, and tell him every word as I shall tell it thee. Bid him call to arms with speed\n",
      "his warriors, for now he shall take the strong city of Troy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To the tent of Agamemnon sped the Dream. Taking the form of the old warrior who had striven\n",
      "to make peace between Agamemnon and Achilles, the Dream stooped over the sleeping warrior,\n",
      "and thus to him it spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sleepest thou, Agamemnon? Ill fits it for the overlord of so mighty a host to sleep all through\n",
      "the night. From Zeus I come, and to thee he sends this message: 'Call to arms with speed thy\n",
      "warriors, Agamemnon, for now shalt thou take the strong city of Troy.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Off then sped the Dream, winging its way like a strip of gray mist aloft to Mount Olympus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Agamemnon awoke from sleep, and the voice of the Dream still rang in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speedily he arose from his bed, donned his fair tunic, cast around him his great cloak, and\n",
      "bound his sandals on his feet. Then over his shoulder he cast his silver-studded sword, and\n",
      "with the scepter of his house, token of his overlordship, in his hand, he went down to where\n",
      "the Greek ships lay, and called a council together.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his lords he told what had befallen him as they slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Call to arms!\" had been the message from Zeus. \"Call to arms! for victory shall be thine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the old warrior in whose likeness the Dream had come:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friends, had any other told us this dream we might deem it false; but to our overlord the\n",
      "Dream hath come. Let us then call our men to arms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So did all the lords follow his counsel, and quickly did the Greeks obey their summons. Like\n",
      "bees that pour from out their nests in some hollow rock, and fly to where the spring flowers\n",
      "grow most sweet, even so did the warriors pour forth from their ships and their huts by the\n",
      "sea. Loudly they shouted as they came, till all the earth echoed. Nine heralds sought to quiet\n",
      "them, but it was long before they would cease their noise, and sit silent to listen to the\n",
      "voice of Agamemnon their lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Agamemnon prove his people. \"Ill hath Zeus dealt with us, my friends,\" he said. \"To\n",
      "us he promised ere we sailed hither that victory should be ours. But nine years have passed\n",
      "away, and our ships' timbers have rotted, and the rigging is worn. In our halls our wives and\n",
      "children still sit awaiting us, yet are we no nearer victory than we were on the day that we\n",
      "came hither. Come then, let us flee with our ships to our dear native land, for never shall\n",
      "Troy be ours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Agamemnon, and stirred the hearts of all that had not heard his secret council.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the high sea-waves are swayed by the winds that rush upon them from the east and from the\n",
      "south, even so the Greek host was swayed. And even as the west wind sweeps over a cornfield\n",
      "and all the ears bow down before the blast, so were the warriors stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shouting, they hastened down to their ships. And the dust rose up in clouds from under their\n",
      "hurrying feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly did they prepare their ships, and gladly did they make them ready to sail homeward\n",
      "across the bright salt sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then would the Greeks have returned, even though fate willed it not. But Hera spoke to Athene.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we indeed allow the Greeks thus to flee homeward?\" she cried. \"Shame it will be to us\n",
      "if Helen is left, in Troy, and Paris goes unpunished. Haste, then, and with thy gentle words\n",
      "hold back the men from setting forth in their ships for their own homeland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down from the peaks of Olympus darted the bright-eyed Athene, clown to where the dark ships\n",
      "were being dragged to the launching ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "By his ship stood Odysseus of the many devices, and heavy of heart was he.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one who speaks aloud the thoughts of another, so then to Odysseus spake the fair goddess\n",
      "who was ever his guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will ye indeed fling yourselves upon your ships and flee homeward to your own land?\" she said.\n",
      "\"Will brave Odysseus leave Helen, for whose sake so many Greeks have died, to be the boast\n",
      "of the men of Troy? Hasten, then, and suffer not the Greeks to drag their ships down to the sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sound of the voice of Athene, Odysseus cast away his mantle and ran to meet Agamemnon.\n",
      "From him he received the scepter of overlordship, and bearing it he went among the ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever he saw a chief, he would say to him with gentle words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good sir, it fits thee ill to be a coward. Stay, now, for thou knowest not what is the will\n",
      "of Agamemnon. He is only making trial of thee. Hold back then thy people, and anger him not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Odysseus met a common man hasting to the ships, with his scepter he smote him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit still, sir, and listen to the words of thy betters. No warrior art thou, but a weakling.\n",
      "One king only hath Zeus given to us. Hearken then to the will of Agamemnon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did Odysseus rule the people, driving them back from the ships to where sat Agamemnon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the noise they made in returning was as the noise of mighty waves of the sea, when they\n",
      "crash upon the beach and drive their roaring echoes far abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence came upon them as they sat themselves down before Agamemnon and their lords. Upon all\n",
      "but one did silence fall. Thersites, bandy-legged, round-shouldered, lame of one foot, with\n",
      "ugly head covered with scanty stubble, most ill-favored of all men in the host, would not hold\n",
      "his peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrilly he poured his upbraidings upon Agamemnon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lackest thou now?\" he cried. \"Surely thy huts are full of the spoils we have brought\n",
      "to thee each time we have taken a town. What more dost thou want? Soft fools, women, not men,\n",
      "are ye Greeks, else would ye return home now with the ships, and leave this fellow here in\n",
      "Troyland gorging himself on the spoils for which he himself hath never fought. To brave Achilles\n",
      "hath he done dishonor, a far better man than he!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Straight to the side of Thersites came the goodly Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold thy peace,\" he sternly said. \"Plainly I tell thee that if ever again I find thee raving\n",
      "as thou hast raved now, I myself will strip off thy mantle and tunic, with shameful blows beat\n",
      "thee out of the assembly, and send thee back weeping to the ships.\"\n",

      "So spake Odysseus, and with his scepter smote Thersites on his back and shoulders. And Thersites\n",
      "bowed down, and big tears fell from his eyes, and a bloody weal from the golden scepter stood\n",
      "up from his back. Amazed he sat down, and in pain and amazement he wiped away a tear. The others,\n",

      "we set sail for Troyland, the mighty portent that we saw? As we offered sacrifices to the gods\n",
      "beneath a fair plane-tree whence flowed clear water, a snake, blood-red on the back and dreadful\n",
      "to look upon, glided from beneath the altar and darted to the tree. On the tree's topmost bough\n",
      "was a sparrow's nest, and in it eight tender nestlings, over which the mother bird spread her\n",
      "wings. Pitifully did the little ones cheep as the snake swallowed them all, and pitifully cried\n",
      "the mother as she fluttered over her nestlings. But of her, too, did the snake lay hold, coiling\n",
      "himself round her and crushing her life out. Then did the god who sent this sign show us that\n",
      "a sign from the gods in truth it was, for he turned the snake into stone. And Chalcas, our\n",
      "soothsayer, told us then the meaning of the sign. 'Nine years,' said he--for nine birds did\n",
      "the snake slay--'shall ye fight in Troyland, but in the tenth year the city shall fall before\n",
      "you.' So then, let us abide here, until we have taken the great city!\"\n",

      "When Odysseus had ceased to speak, the Greeks shouted aloud, until the ships echoed the praises\n",
      "of the goodly Odysseus.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go now, all of you, and eat, that ye may be ready for battle. Let each man sharpen well his\n",
      "spear and see to his shield, and see to it that the horses are well fed and the chariots prepared.\n",

      "for him shall there be no hope hereafter, but he shall be food for dogs and for birds of prey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Agamemnon had spoken, the shouts of the Greeks were as the thunder of mighty breakers\n",

      "\n",

      "To meet the great Greek host came the men of Troy. With loud shouting and clamor they came,\n",
      "noisy as the flocks of cranes that fly to far-off seas before the coming of winter and sudden rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in silence marched the Greeks, shoulder to shoulder, their hearts full of courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the mist that rolls from the crest of the mountains until no man can see in front of him\n",
      "further than the cast of a stone, so did the dust rise in clouds under the tread of the warriors'\n",
      "feet as they marched across the plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front to front did the two armies stand at last, and from the Trojan ranks strode forth Paris\n",
      "the godlike, he who robbed Menelaus of her who was to him most dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the shoulders of Paris swung a panther's skin. He bore a curved bow and sword, and, brandishing\n",
      "two bronze-headed spears, he challenged all the chieftains of the Greek host to fight him,\n",
      "man to man, in mortal fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a hungry lion rejoices to see a great-horned stag coming to be his prey, even so did Menelaus\n",
      "rejoice when he saw Paris, the golden-haired and blue-eyed, stride proudly forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Straightway, in his armor, did Menelaus leap from his chariot to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Paris saw him to whom he had done so sore a wrong, his heart was smitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a man who, in a mountain glen, suddenly sees a deadly snake and shrinks away from it with\n",
      "shaking limbs, even so did Paris shrink back among his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scornfully did Hector his brother behold him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fair in face thou art!\" said Hector, \"but shamed I am by thee! I ween these long-haired Greeks\n",
      "make sport of us because we have for champion one whose face and form are beautiful, but in\n",
      "whose heart is neither strength nor courage. Art thou a coward? and yet thou daredst to sail\n",
      "across the sea and steal from her husband the fair woman who hath brought us so much harm.\n",
      "Thou shalt see what sort of warrior is he whose lovely wife thou hast taken. Thy harp and thy\n",
      "golden locks and fair face, and all the graces given to thee by Aphrodite, shall count for\n",
      "little when thou liest in the dust! Cowards must we Trojans be, else thou hadst been stoned\n",
      "to death ere this, for all the evil thou hast wrought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then answered Paris:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No word hast thou said that I do not deserve, brave Hector. Yet scorn not the gifts of golden\n",
      "Aphrodite, for by his own desire can no man win the love and beauty that the goddess gives.\n",
      "But let me now do battle with Menelaus. Make the Trojans and the men of Greece sit down, while\n",
      "Menelaus and I fight for Helen. Let him who is conqueror have her and all that is hers for\n",
      "his own, and let the others take an oath of friendship so that the Greeks may depart in peace\n",
      "to their own land, and in peace the Trojans dwell in Troy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Greatly did Hector rejoice at his brother's word. His spear grasped by the middle, he went\n",
      "through the Trojan ranks and bid the warriors hold back.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he went, the Greeks shot arrows at brave Hector and cast stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold! hold! ye Greeks,\" called Agamemnon. \"Hector of the glancing helm hath somewhat to say\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In silence, then, the two armies stood, while Hector told them the words of Paris his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had heard him, Menelaus spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many ills have ye endured,\" he said, \"for my sake and because of the sins of Paris. Yet now,\n",
      "I think, the end of this long war hath come. Let us fight, then, and death and fate shall decide\n",
      "which of us shall die. Let us offer sacrifice now to Zeus, and call hither Priam, King of Troy.\n",
      "I fear for the faith of his sons, Paris and Hector, but Priam is an old man and will not break\n",
      "faith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then were the Greeks and the Trojans glad. They came down from their chariots, and took off\n",
      "their arms, and laid them on the ground, while heralds went to tell Priam and to fetch lambs\n",
      "and a ram for the sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they went, Hera sent to Troy Iris, her messenger, in the guise of the fairest daughter\n",
      "of Priam.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the hall where Helen sat came lovely Iris. And there she found Helen, fairest of women,\n",
      "her white arms swiftly moving back and forward as she wove a great purple web of double wool,\n",
      "and wrought thereon pictures of many battles of the Greeks and the men of Troy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither, dear lady,\" said Iris, \"and see a wondrous thing. For they that so fiercely fought\n",
      "with each other, now sit in silence. The battle is stayed; they lean upon their shields, and\n",
      "their tall spears are thrust in the earth by their sides. But for thee are Menelaus and Paris\n",
      "now going to fight, and thou shalt be the wife of the conqueror.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake lovely Iris, and into the sleeping heart of Helen there came remembrance, and a hungry\n",
      "longing for her old home, and for Menelaus, and her father and mother, and for little Hermione,\n",
      "her child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tears rolled down her cheeks, but quickly she hid her face with a veil of fair linen, and\n",
      "hastened out, with her two handmaidens, to the place where the two armies lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the ScÃ¦an gates sat Priam and other old warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Helen, in her fair white robes, drew near, the old men marveled at her loveliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small wonder is it,\" said they, \"that Trojans and Greeks should suffer hardships and lay down\n",
      "their lives for one so beautiful. Yet well would it be for her to sail away upon the Greek\n",
      "ships rather than stay here to bring trouble upon us now, and upon our children hereafter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Priam called to Helen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither, dear child, and sit beside me, that thou may'st see the man who once was thy\n",
      "husband, and thy kinsmen, and thy friends. No blame do I give to thee for all our woes, but\n",
      "only to the gods who have chosen thee to be the cause of all this bloodshed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Priam ask her the names of the mighty heroes who stood by their spears in the Grecian\n",
      "ranks, and Helen, making answer to him, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear father of Paris, my lord, would that I had died ere I left my own land and my little\n",
      "child, and all those that I loved, and followed thy son hither. Agamemnon, a goodly king and\n",
      "a mighty spearsman, is the Greek warrior whose name thou dost ask. Brother of him who was my\n",
      "husband is he. Ah! shameless me, who did leave mine own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Odysseus also, and of many another warrior of great stature and brave looks, did Priam make\n",
      "inquiry. And Helen told him all she knew, while tears of longing stood in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My two brethren, Castor, tamer of horses, and Polydeuces, the skilful boxer, I do not see,\"\n",
      "she said; \"mayhap they have not crossed the sea.\" For she knew not that her two brothers lay\n",
      "dead in her own beautiful land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then was the sacrifice to Zeus offered, and the vows made between Agamemnon and Priam, King\n",
      "of Troy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sacrifice and vows were accomplished, Priam in haste mounted his chariot and drove away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Verily will I return to windy Ilios,\" said the old man, \"for I cannot bear to watch the fight\n",
      "between Menelaus and my own dear son. But only Zeus and the gods know which one of them is\n",
      "to fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hector and Odysseus marked out a space for the fight, and into a bronze helmet Hector\n",
      "placed two pebbles and shook them in the helmet, looking behind him. And the pebble of Paris\n",
      "leapt out the first, so that to him fell the lot to cast first his spear of bronze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Paris arm himself. Greaves of beauteous fashioning he placed upon his legs, and fastened\n",
      "them with silver ankle-clasps. Over his shoulders he put his silver-studded sword of bronze\n",
      "and his great shield. On his head he placed a helmet with nodding crest of horsehair, and in\n",
      "his hand he grasped his strong spear. In like manner did Menelaus arm himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "One moment did they stand face to face, wrath and hatred in their hearts, their spears gripped\n",
      "firm in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Paris hurl his spear and smite the shield of Menelaus. But the shield was strong and\n",
      "the spear could not pierce it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand lifted up for the cast, Menelaus looked upwards and called to Zeus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grant me revenge, great Zeus!\" he cried. \"On him that hath done me grievous wrong, grant me\n",
      "vengeance, so that all men hereafter may shudder to wrong one who hath treated him as his honored\n",
      "guest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then hurled he his mighty spear. Through the bright shield it went, and through the shining\n",
      "breastplate, tearing the tunic of Paris on his thigh. But Paris swerved aside, and so escaped\n",
      "death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Menelaus drew his silver-studded sword and drove it crashing down upon the helmet of Paris.\n",
      "But in four pieces was the sword shattered, and fell from the hand of Menelaus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely art thou the most cruel of all the gods, Zeus!\" angrily he cried. \"My spear is cast\n",
      "in vain, and my sword shattered, and my vengeance is still to come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he leapt upon Paris. By the crest on his helmet he seized him, and, swinging him\n",
      "round, he dragged him towards the Greek host. The embroidered strap beneath the helmet of Paris\n",
      "strangled him, and so he would have shamefully died, had not Aphrodite marked his plight. Swiftly\n",
      "did she burst the leather strap, and the helmet was left empty in the grasp of Menelaus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Casting the empty helmet, with a swing, to his comrades, Menelaus sprang back, ready, with\n",
      "another spear, to slay his enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aphrodite snatched Paris up, and in thick mist she hid him, and bore him away to his own\n",
      "home. Like a wild beast Menelaus strode through the host, searching for him. But no Trojan\n",
      "would have hidden him, for with a bitter hatred did the men of Troy hate Paris, most beautiful\n",
      "of mortal men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Agamemnon:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hearken to me, ye Trojans. Now hath Menelaus gained the victory. Give us back Helen, and all\n",
      "that is hers, and pay me the recompense that ye owe me for all the evil days that are gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and glad were the shouts of the Greeks as they heard the words of their king.\n",

      "HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE\n",
      "\n",
      "From where the battle still raged went Hector, son of Priam. At the oak-tree by the gates of\n",
      "Troy there came running to meet him wives and daughters of those who fought. For eagerly did\n",
      "they long for tidings of many a warrior who now lay dead on the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the beautiful, many-pillared palace of his father, his mother came to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand she took in hers, and gently spoke she to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Art thou wearied that thou hast left the battle, Hector, my son?\" she said. \"Let me bring\n",
      "thee wine that thou may'st be refreshed and yet gain strength.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring me no wine, dear mother,\" said Hector, \"lest it take from me the strength and courage\n",
      "that I have. Rather go thou to the temple of Athene and offer her sacrifices, beseeching that\n",
      "she will have mercy on Troy and on the wives of the Trojans and their little children. So may\n",
      "she hold back Diomedes the destroyer. I go to Paris--would that he were dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mother of Hector straightway, with other old women, the mothers of heroes, offered\n",
      "sacrifices and prayers to Athene. But Athene paid no heed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the palace of Paris, his mighty bronze spear in his hand, then strode Hector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris, the golden-haired, sat in a room with Helen, idly handling his shining shield and breastplate\n",
      "and curved bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In bitter scorn spoke Hector to his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our people die in battle for thy sake!\" he cried, \"while here thou sittest idle. Up then,\n",
      "ere the enemies that thou hast made for us burn our city to the ground!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Paris answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Justly dost thou chide me, Hector. Even now hath Helen urged me to play the man and go back\n",
      "to battle. Only let me put on my armor, and soon will I overtake thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never a word did Hector answer him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to Hector did Helen then speak:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brother Hector,\" she said, \"unworthy am I to be sister of thine. Would that I had died on\n",
      "the day I was born, or would that the gods who have brought me this evil had given me for a\n",
      "husband one who was shamed by reproach and who feared dishonor. Rest thee here, my brother,\n",
      "who hast suffered so much for the sake of wretched me and for the sin of Paris. Well I know\n",
      "that for us cometh punishment of which men will sing in the far-off years that are yet to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of thy love, ask me not to stay, Helen,\" answered Hector. \"For to help the men of Troy is\n",
      "my whole heart set, and they are now in want of me. But rouse this fellow, and make him hasten\n",
      "after me. I go now to see my dear wife and my babe, for I know not whether I shall return to\n",
      "them again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his own house Hector found not his fair wife Andromache, nor their little babe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whither went thy mistress?\" he asked in eagerness of the serving-women.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly, my lord,\" answered one, \"tidings came to us that the Trojans were sorely pressed and\n",
      "that with the Greeks was the victory. So then did Andromache, like one frenzied, hasten with\n",
      "her child and his nurse to the walls that she might see somewhat of what befell. There, on\n",
      "the tower, she stands now, weeping and wailing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Back through the streets by which he had come then hastened Hector. And as he drew near the\n",
      "gates, Andromache, who had spied him from afar, ran to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, hand clasped in hand, Andromache and Hector stood, Hector looked silently at the beautiful\n",
      "babe in his nurse's arms, and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astyanax, \"The City King,\" those of Troy called the child, because it was Hector his father\n",
      "who saved the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Andromache:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear lord, thy courage will bring thee death. Hast thou no pity for this babe nor for thy\n",
      "wife, who so soon shall be thy widow? Better would it be for me to die if to thee death should\n",
      "come. For if I lose thee, then sorrow must for evermore be mine. No father nor mother have\n",
      "I, and on one day were my seven brothers slain. Father and mother and brother art thou to me,\n",
      "Hector, and my dear loved husband as well. Have pity now, and stay with thy wife and thy little\n",
      "child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All these things know I well, my wife,\" answered Hector, \"but black shame would be mine were\n",
      "I to shrink like a coward from battle. Ever it hath been mine to be where the fight was fiercest,\n",
      "and to win glory for my father's name, and for my own. But soon will that glory be gone, for\n",
      "my heart doth tell me that Troy must fall. Yet for the sorrows of the Trojans, and of my own\n",
      "father and mother and brethren, and of the many heroes that must perish, grieve I less bitterly\n",
      "than for the anguish that must come upon thee on that day when thou no longer hast a husband\n",
      "to fight for thee and a Greek leads thee away a prisoner. May the earth be heaped up high above\n",
      "me ere I hear thy crying, Andromache!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Hector, and stretched out his arms to take his boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from his father's bronze helmet with its fiercely nodding plume of horsehair the babe shrank\n",
      "back in terror and hid his face in his nurse's breast. Then did the little City King's father\n",
      "and his sweet mother laugh aloud, and on the ground Hector laid his helmet, and taking his\n",
      "little son in his arms he kissed him and gently dandled him. And as he did so, thus Hector\n",
      "prayed to Zeus and all the gods:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Zeus and all ye gods, grant that my son may be a brave warrior and a great king in Troyland.\n",
      "Let men say of him when he returns from battle, 'Far greater is he than his father,' and may\n",
      "he gladden his mother's heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Hector lay his babe in Andromache's arms, and she held him to her bosom, smiling through\n",
      "her tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of love and pity and tenderness was the heart of Hector, and gently he caressed her and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear one, I pray thee be not of over-sorrowful heart. No man shall slay me ere the time appointed\n",
      "for my death hath come. Go home and busy thyself with loom and distaff and see to the work\n",
      "of thy maidens. But war is for us men, and of all those who dwell in Troyland, most of all for me.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Not far behind Hector followed Paris, his armor glittering like the sun, and with a laugh on\n",

      "While round the dark ships of Greece the fierce fight raged, Achilles, from afar, listened\n",
      "unmoved to the din of battle, and watched with stony eyes the men of Greece as they fell and\n",
      "died on the reddened ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "To him came Patroclus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why dost thou weep, Patroclus?\" asked Achilles. \"Like a fond little maid art thou that runs\n",
      "by her mother's side, plucking at her gown, hindering her as she walks, and with tearful eyes\n",
      "looking up at her until the mother lifts her in her arms. Like her, Patroclus, dost thou softly\n",
      "weep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Patroclus, heavily groaning, made answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Among the ships lie the bravest and best of the men of Greece, sore wounded or dead. Pitiless\n",
      "art thou, Achilles, pitiless and unforgiving. Yet if thou dost still hold back from the battle,\n",
      "give me, I pray thee, thine armor, and send me forth in thy stead. Perchance the Trojans may\n",
      "take me for the mighty Achilles, and even now the victory be ours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Achilles, and heavy was his heart within him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These Greeks took from me my well-won prize, Patroclus. Yet let the past be past; no man may\n",
      "keep his anger for ever. I have said that until the men of Troy come to burn my own ships I\n",
      "will hold me back from the battle. But take you my armor; lead my men in the fight, and drive\n",
      "from the ships the men of Troy. But to others leave it to chase them across the plain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as Achilles spoke, the strength of mighty Ajax had come to an end, and with furious rush\n",
      "did the Trojans board the ships. In their hands they bore blazing torches, and up to the sky\n",
      "rushed the fiercely roaring flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then cried Achilles, smiting his thighs:\n",

      "\n",
      "Corslet and shield and helmet did Patroclus swiftly don, and girded on the silver-studded sword\n",

      "In the chariot of Achilles he mounted, and Automedon, best and bravest of charioteers, took\n",
      "the reins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swift as the wild west wind were Bayard and Piebald, the two horses of Achilles, and in the\n",

      "Out of the ships were they driven, the fire was quenched, and back to the trench rolled the\n",

      "across it leaped the horses of Achilles, and close to the walls of Troy did Patroclus drive\n",
      "brave Hector before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His chariot then he turned, and headed off the fleeing Trojans, driving them down to the ships.\n",
      "Before the furious rush of his swift steeds, other horses were borne off their feet, other\n",
      "chariots cast in ruins on the ground, and men crushed to death under his wheels. Chief after\n",

      "With the first cast of his spear Patroelus missed Sarpedon, but slew his charioteer. Then did\n",
      "Sarpedon cast, and his spear whizzed past Patroclus, and smote the good horse Pedasus. With\n",
      "a dreadful scream Pedasus fell, kicking and struggling, in the dust. This way and that did\n",
      "the other two horses plunge and rear, until the yoke creaked and the reins became entangled.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once again did Sarpedon cast his spear, and the point flew over the left shoulder of Patroclus.\n",

      "like a slim tree before the axe of the wood-cutter he fell, his dying hands clutching at the\n",
      "bloody dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furious was the combat then over the body of Sarpedon. One brave warrior after another did\n",

      "man dropped to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nimble a man is this!\" jeered Patroclus. \"How lightly he diveth! Were this the sea, how\n",
      "good an oyster-seeker would this fellow be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then from his chariot leaped Hector and met Patroclus, and the noise of the battle was as the\n",

      "\n",
      "When the sun went down, victory was with the Greeks. Three mighty charges did Patroclus make,\n",
      "and each time he slew nine men. But when, a fourth time, he charged, Apollo met him. In thick\n",
      "mist he met him, and Patroclus knew not that he fought with a god. With a fierce down-stroke\n",
      "from behind, Apollo smote his broad shoulders, and from off his head the helmet of Achilles\n",
      "fell with a clang, rattling under the hoofs of the horses. Before the smiting of the god, Patroclus\n",
      "stood stricken, stupid and amazed. Shattered in his hands was the spear of Achilles, and his\n",
      "mighty shield clanged on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere he could know who was the smiter, a Trojan ally drove a spear between his shoulders, and\n",
      "Patroclus, sore wounded, fell back.\n",

      "\n",
      "But for him fought the Greeks, until the earth was wet with blood and the very skies echoed\n",

      "\n",
      "To Achilles came Antilochos, a messenger fleet of foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fallen is Patroclus!\" he cried, \"and around his naked body do they fight, for his armor is\n",
      "held by Hector.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Achilles moan aloud. On the ground he lay, and in his hair he poured black ashes.\n",
      "And the sound of his terrible lament was heard by his mother, Thetis, the goddess, as she sat\n",
      "in her palace down under the depths of the green sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up from under the waves swiftly came she to Achilles, and tenderly did she listen while he\n",

      "\n",
      "Then said Thetis:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not long, methinks, shall Hector glory in the armor that was thine, for Death presseth hard\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, all unarmed, did Achilles go forth, and stood beside the trench. With a mighty voice\n",

      "they went, and from among the dead did the Greeks draw the body of Patroclus, and hot were\n",
      "the tears that Achilles shed for the friend whom he had sent forth to battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that night, in the house of the Immortals, resounded the clang of hammer on anvil as Hephaistus,\n",

      "Bronze and silver and gold he threw in his fire, and golden handmaidens helped their master\n",

      "And in the morning light did Thetis dart down from snowy Olympus, bearing in her arms the splendid\n",

      "to the fight once again. Wounded was Agamemnon, overlord of the Greeks, but forth also came\n",
      "he. And there, while the sun rose on many a warrior who would fight no more, did Achilles and\n",

      "Thus ended the fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "For twelve days did the Greek host rejoice, and all through the days Hector's body lay unburied.\n",
      "For at the heels of swift horses had the Greeks dragged him to the ships, while from the battlements\n",
      "his mother and his wife Andromache watched, wailing in agony, with hearts that broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at length went old Priam to the camp of the Greeks. And before Achilles he fell, beseeching\n",

      "\n",
      "Telemachus loved his beautiful mother, Penelope, but his heart always longed for the hero father\n",
      "whom he could only dimly remember. As time went on, he longed more and more, for evil things\n",

      "So they came to the palace where Penelope and Telemachus lived, and there they stayed, year\n",
      "in, year out, feasting and drinking and wasting the goods of Odysseus. Their roughness and\n",
      "greed troubled Penelope, but still more did they each one daily torment her by rudely asking:\n",
      "\"Wilt thou marry me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At last she fell on a plan to stop them from talking to her of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the palace hall she set up a great web, beautiful and fine of woof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said, \"When I have finished weaving this robe I shall give you my answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Each day she worked at it, but each night, when the wooers slept, she undid all that she had\n",
      "done during the day. So it seemed to the wooers as if the robe would never be finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Penelope's heart was heavy, and heavy, too, was the heart of Telemachus. For three weary years,\n",
      "while Odysseus was imprisoned on the island of Calypso, the mother and son pined together.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Telemachus sat at the door of the palace sadly watching the wooers as they drank and\n",

      "to the door of the courtyard a stranger dressed like a warrior from another land.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger was the goddess Athene. At the same time that she gained leave from the gods to\n",

      "sandals on her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus rose up and shook her kindly by the hand, and led her into the hall. He took from\n",
      "her the heavy bronze spear that she carried, and made her sit down on one of the finest of\n",
      "the chairs, in a place where the noise of the rough wooers should not disturb her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Welcome, stranger,\" he said. \"When thou hast had food, then shalt thou tell us in what way\n",
      "we can help thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then made servants bring a silver basin and golden ewer that she might wash her hands, and\n",
      "he fetched her food and wine of the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the wooers entered, and noisily ate they and drank, and roughly jested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus watched them and listened with an angry heart. Then, in a low voice, he said to Athene:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These men greedily eat and drink, and waste my father's goods. They think the bones of Odysseus\n",
      "bleach out in the rain in a far land, or are tossed about by the sea. But did my father still\n",
      "live, and were he to come home, the cowards would flee before him. Tell me, stranger, hast\n",
      "thou come from a far-off country? Hast thou ever seen my father?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Athene answered: \"Odysseus still lives. He is a prisoner on a sea-girt island, but it will\n",
      "not be long ere he escapes and comes home. Thou art like Odysseus, my son. Thou hast a head\n",
      "like his, and the same beautiful eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Athene spoke to him so kindly and so hopefully, Telemachus told her all that was in his\n",

      "angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art in sore need of Odysseus,\" she said. \"If Odysseus were to come to the door now with\n",
      "lance in hand, soon would he scatter those shameless ones before him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told Telemachus what he must do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To-morrow,\" said she, \"call thy lords to a council meeting, and tell the wooers to return\n",
      "to their homes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For himself, she told him to fit out a ship with twenty oars-men, that he might sail to a land\n",
      "where he should get tidings of his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art tall and handsome, my friend,\" she said. \"Be brave, that even in days to come men\n",
      "may praise thy name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou speakest as a father to a son. I will never forget what thou hast said,\" said Telemachus.\n",
      "\n",
      "He begged Athene to stay longer, and wished to give her a costly gift. But she would not stay,\n",
      "nor accept any present. To Telemachus she had given a gift, though he did not know it. For\n",
      "into his heart she had put strength and courage, so that when she flew away like a beautiful\n",
      "bird across the sea she left behind her, not a frightened, unhappy boy, but a strong, brave man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wooers took no notice of the comings and goings of the strange warrior, so busy were they\n",
      "with their noisy feast. As they feasted a minstrel played to them on his lyre, and sang a song\n",
      "of the return of the warriors from Troyland when the fighting was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "From her room above, Penelope heard the song, and came down. For a little, standing by the\n",
      "door, she listened. Then she could bear it no longer, and, weeping, she said to the minstrel:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sing some other song, and do not sing a song of return from Troyland to me, whose husband\n",
      "never returned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Telemachus, in a new and manly way that made her wonder, spoke to his mother:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blame not the minstrel, dear mother,\" he said. \"It is not his fault that he sings sad songs,\n",
      "but the fault of the gods who allow sad things to be. Thou art not the only one who hast lost\n",
      "a loved one in Troyland. Go back to thy room, and let me order what shall be, for I am now\n",
      "the head of the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same fearless, manly way he spoke to the wooers:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye may feast to-night,\" he said; \"only let there be no brawling. To-morrow meet with me. For\n",
      "once and for all it must be decided if ye are to go on wasting my goods, or if I am to be master\n",
      "of my own house and king in mine own land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wooers bit their lips with rage, and some of them answered him rudely; but Telemachus paid\n",
      "no heed, and when at last they returned to their houses, he went upstairs to his own room.\n",
      "The old woman who had nursed him when he was a child carried torches before him to show him\n",
      "the way. When he sat down on his bed and took off his doublet, she folded and smoothed it and\n",
      "hung it up. Then she shut the door with its silver handle, and left Telemachus, wrapped in\n",
      "a soft fleece of wool, thinking far into the night of all that Athene had said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When day dawned he dressed and buckled on his sword, and told heralds to call the lords to\n",
      "a council meeting. When all were assembled he went into the hall. In his hand he carried a\n",
      "bronze spear, and two of his hounds followed him, and when he went up to his father's seat\n",
      "and sat down there, the oldest men gave place to him. For Athene had shed on him such a wondrous\n",
      "grace that he looked like a young god.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never since brave Odysseus sailed away to Troyland have we had a council meeting,\" said one\n",
      "old lord. \"I think the man who hath called this meeting is a true man--good luck go with him!\n",
      "May the gods give him his heart's desire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So good a beginning did this seem that Telemachus was glad, and, burning to say all that had\n",
      "been in his heart for so long, he rose to his feet and spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the loss of his father he spoke sadly, and then, with burning words, of the cowardly wooers,\n",
      "of their feastings and revelings and wasting of his goods, and of their insolence to Penelope\n",
      "and himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had thus spoken in rage and grief, he burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a little there was silence, then one of the wooers said angrily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Penelope is to blame, and no other. For three years she has deceived us. 'I will give you\n",
      "my answer when I have finished weaving this robe,' she said, and so we waited and waited. But\n",
      "now that three years have gone and a fourth has begun, it is told us by one of her maids that\n",
      "each night she has undone all she has woven during the day. She can deceive us no longer. She\n",
      "must now finish the robe, and tell us whom she will marry. For we will not leave this place\n",
      "until she has chosen a husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, once again, with pleading words, Telemachus tried to move the hearts of the wooers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If ye will not go,\" at last he said, \"I will ask the gods to reward you for your wickedness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, two eagles flew, fleet as the wind, from the mountain crest. Side by side they\n",
      "flew until they were above the place of the council meeting. Then they wheeled about, darted\n",
      "with fury at each other, and tore with their savage talons at each other's heads and necks.\n",
      "Flapping their great wings, they then went swiftly away and were lost in the far distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said a wise old man: \"It is an omen. Odysseus will return, and woe will come upon the wooers.\n",
      "Let us make an end of these evil doings and keep harm away from us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go home, old man,\" angrily mocked the wooers. \"Prophesy to thine own children. Odysseus is\n",
      "dead. Would that thou hadst died with him. Then thou couldst not have babbled nonsense, and\n",
      "tried to hound on Telemachus in the hope that he may give thee a gift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Telemachus they said again:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will go on wasting thy goods until Penelope weds one of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only one other beside the old man was brave enough to speak for Telemachus. Fearlessly and\n",
      "nobly did his friend Mentor blame the wooers for their shamelessness. But they jeered at him,\n",
      "and laughed aloud when Telemachus told them he was going to take a ship and go to look for\n",
      "his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will never come back,\" said one, \"and even were Odysseus himself to return, we should slay\n",
      "him when he came.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the council meeting broke up, and the wooers went again to revel in the palace of Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down to the seashore went Telemachus and knelt where the gray water broke in little white wavelets\n",
      "on the sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"thou who didst speak with me yesterday. I know now that thou art a god.\n",
      "Tell me, I pray thee? how shall I find a ship to sail across the misty sea and find my father?\n",
      "For there is none to help me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiftly, in answer to his cry, came Athene.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be brave. Be thy father's son,\" she said. \"Go back to thy house and get ready corn and wine\n",
      "for the voyage. I will choose the best of all the ships in Ithaca for thee, and have her launched,\n",
      "and manned by a crew, all of them willing men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Telemachus returned to the palace. In the courtyard the wooers were slaying goats and\n",
      "singeing swine and making ready a great feast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here comes Telemachus, who is planning to destroy us,\" they mocked. \"Telemachus, who speaks\n",
      "so proudly--- angry Telemachus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Said one youth:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who knows but what if he goes on a voyage he will be like Odysseus, and never return. Then\n",
      "will we have all his riches to divide among ourselves, and his house will belong to the man\n",
      "who weds Penelope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus shook off the jeering crowd, and went down to the vaulted chamber where his father's\n",
      "treasures were kept. Gold and bronze lay there in piles, and there were great boxes of splendid\n",
      "clothes, and casks of wine. The heavy folding doors of the treasure chamber were shut day and\n",
      "night, and the old nurse was the keeper of the treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus bade her get ready corn and wine for the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When my mother has gone to rest I will take them away,\" he said, \"for this night I go to seek\n",
      "my father across the sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the old nurse began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not go, dear child,\" she wailed. \"Thou art our only one, and we love thee so well. Odysseus\n",
      "is dead, and what canst thou do, sailing far away across the deep sea? As soon as thou art\n",
      "gone, those wicked men will begin to plot evil against thee. Do not go. Do not go. There is\n",
      "no need for thee to risk thy life on the sea and go wandering far from home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take heart, nurse,\" said Telemachus. \"The goddess Athene has told me to go, so all will be\n",
      "well. But promise me not to tell my dear mother that I am gone until she misses me. For I do\n",
      "not wish to mar her fair face with tears.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nurse promised, and began to make ready all that Telemachus wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime Athene, in the likeness of Telemachus, found a swift-sailing ship, and men to sail\n",
      "it. When darkness fell, she sent sleep on the wooers and led Telemachus down to the shore where\n",
      "his men sat by their oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the palace, where every one slept and all was still and quiet, Telemachus brought his men.\n",
      "None but the old nurse knew he was going away, but they found the food and wine that she had\n",
      "got ready and carried it down to the ship. Then Athene went on board, and Telemachus sat beside\n",
      "her. A fresh west wind filled the sails and went singing over the waves. The dark water surged\n",
      "up at the bow as the ship cut through it. And all night long and till the dawn, the ship sailed\n",
      "happily on her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunrise they came to land, and Athene and Telemachus went on shore. The rulers of the country\n",
      "welcomed them and treated them well, but could tell nothing of Odysseus after the siege of\n",
      "Troy was over. Athene gave Telemachus into their care, then, turning herself into a sea-eagle,\n",
      "she flew swiftly away, leaving them amazed because they knew she must be one of the gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Telemachus sought for news of his father in this kingdom, and the kingdoms near it, the\n",
      "wooers began to miss him at their feasts. They fancied he was away hunting, until, one day,\n",
      "as they played games in front of the palace, the man whose ship Athene had borrowed came to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When will Telemachus return with my ship?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I need it that I may cross over to where I keep my horses. I wish to catch one and break him in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wooers heard from him that Telemachus had sailed away with twenty brave youths, in\n",
      "the swiftest ship in Ithaca, they were filled with rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once they got a ship and sailed to where they might meet Telemachus in a strait between\n",
      "Ithaca and another rocky island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will slay him there,\" said they. \"We will give him a woful end to his voyage in search\n",
      "of his father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Penelope heard this, and knew that her son was perhaps sailing to his doom, her heart\n",
      "well-nigh broke. She wept bitterly, and reproached her maidens with not having told her that\n",
      "Telemachus had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Slay me if thou wilt,\" said the old nurse, \"but I alone knew it. Telemachus made me promise\n",
      "not to tell thee, that thy fair face might not be marred by weeping. Do not fear, the goddess\n",
      "Athene will take care of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she comforted her mistress, and although she lay long awake that night, Penelope fell\n",
      "asleep at last. In her dreams Athene came to her and told her that Telemachus would come safely\n",
      "home, and so Penelope's sad heart was cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she slept the wooers sailed away in a swift, black ship, with spears in their hands and\n",
      "murder in their hearts. On a little rocky isle they landed until the ship of Telemachus should\n",
      "pass, and there they waited, that they might slay him when he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW ODYSSEUS CAME HOME\n",
      "\n",
      "While yet Telemachus sought news of his father, Odysseus was well-nigh home. On that misty\n",
      "morning when he found himself in Ithaca, and did not know it, because the gray fog made everything\n",
      "seem strange and unfriendly, Odysseus was very sad as he sat beside the moaning sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came Athene, and drove the mist before her, and Odysseus saw again the land that he loved,\n",
      "and knew that his wanderings were past. She told him the tale of the wooers, and of the unhappiness\n",
      "of Penelope and Telemachus, and the heart of Odysseus grew hot within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand by me!\" he said to the goddess. \"If thou of thy grace wilt help me, I myself will fight\n",
      "three hundred men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly I will stand by thee,\" said Athene, \"and many of the greedy wooers shall stain the earth\n",
      "with their blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then told Odysseus how the wooers were to be destroyed, and Odysseus gladly agreed to her\n",
      "plans. First she made him hide far in the darkness of the cave, under the olive-tree, all the\n",
      "gold and bronze ornaments and beautiful clothes that had been given to him in the land of Nausicaa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she touched him with her golden wand. In a moment his yellow hair fell off his head; his\n",
      "bright eyes were dim; his skin was withered and wrinkled, and he had a stooping back and tottering\n",
      "legs like a feeble old man. His clothes of purple and silver she changed into torn and filthy\n",
      "old rags, and over his shoulders she threw the old skin of a stag with the hair worn off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go now,\" said Athene, \"to where thy faithful swineherd sits on the hill, watching his swine\n",
      "as they grub among the acorns and drink of the clear spring. He has always been true to thee\n",
      "and to thy wife and son. Stay with him and hear all that he has to tell, and I will go and\n",
      "fetch home Telemachus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When thou didst know all, why didst thou not tell Telemachus?\" asked Odysseus. \"Is he, too,\n",
      "to go wandering over stormy seas, far from his own land?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Telemachus will be a braver man for what he has gone through,\" said Athene. \"No harm shall\n",
      "come to him, although the wooers in their black ship wait to slay him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Athene flew across the sea, and Odysseus climbed up a rough track through the woods to\n",
      "where the swineherd had built himself a hut. The hut was made of stones and thorn-branches,\n",
      "and beside it were sties for the swine made in the same way. The wooers had eaten many swine\n",
      "at their daily feasts, but thousands remained. These the swineherd tended, with three men and\n",
      "four fierce dogs to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At an open space on the hill, from whence he could look down at the woods and the sea, Odysseus\n",
      "found the swineherd sitting at the door of his hut making himself a pair of sandals out of\n",
      "brown ox-hide.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the swineherd's dogs saw a dirty, bent old man toiling up the hill, they rushed at him,\n",
      "barking furiously. Up they leapt on him and would have torn him to pieces if their master had\n",
      "not cast away his ox-hide, dashed after them, scolded them and beaten them, and then driven\n",
      "them off with showers of stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my dogs had killed thee I should have been for ever ashamed,\" he said to Odysseus, \"and\n",
      "without that I have enough sorrow. For while my noble master may be wandering in a strange\n",
      "land and lacking food, I have to feed his fat swine for others to eat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So speaking, he led Odysseus to his hut. He laid some brushwood on the floor, spread over it\n",
      "the soft, shaggy skin of a wild goat, and bade Odysseus be seated. Then he went out to the\n",
      "sties, killed two sucking pigs, and roasted them daintily. When they were ready he cut off\n",
      "the choicest bits and gave them to Odysseus, with a bowl of honey-sweet wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Odysseus ate and drank, the swineherd talked to him of the greed and wastefulness of\n",
      "the wooers, and in silence Odysseus listened, planning in his heart how he might punish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me thy master's name,\" he said at length. \"I have traveled in many lands. Perchance I\n",
      "may have seen him, and may give thee news of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the swineherd answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each vagrant who comes straying to the land of Ithaca goes to my mistress with lying tales\n",
      "of how he has seen or heard of my master. She receives them all kindly, and asks many questions,\n",
      "while tears run down her cheeks. You, too, old man, would quickly make up a story if any one\n",
      "would give thee some new clothes. My master is surely dead, and wherever I may go I shall never\n",
      "again find a lord so gentle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Odysseus:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend, I swear to thee that Odysseus shall return. In this year, as the old moon wanes\n",
      "and the new is born, he shall return to his home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the other herds returned that evening they found Odysseus and their master still deep\n",
      "in talk. At night the swineherd made a feast of the best that he had, and still they talked,\n",
      "almost until dawn. The night was black and stormy, and a drenching rain blotted out the moon,\n",
      "but the swineherd, leaving Odysseus lying in the bed he had made for him, with his own thick\n",
      "mantle spread over him, went outside and lay under a rock that sheltered him from the storm,\n",
      "keeping guard on the white-tusked boars that slept around him. And Odysseus knew that he had\n",
      "still at least one servant who was faithful and true.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Odysseus dwelt with the swineherd, Athene sought Telemachus and bade him hasten home.\n",
      "Speedily Telemachus went back to his ship and his men. The hawsers were loosed, the white sail\n",
      "hauled up, and Athene sent a fresh breeze that made the ship cut through the water like a white-winged\n",
      "bird. It was night when they passed the island where the wooers awaited their coming, and in\n",
      "the darkness none saw them go by.\n",
      "\n",
      "By daybreak they reached Ithaca, and Telemachus, as Athene had bidden him, sent on the men\n",
      "to the harbor with the ship, but made them put him ashore on the woody coast near the swineherd's\n",
      "dwelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his bronze-shod spear in his hand, Telemachus strode up the rocky path. Odysseus and the\n",
      "swineherd had kindled a fire, and were preparing the morning meal, when Odysseus heard the\n",
      "noise of footsteps. He looked out and saw a tall lad with yellow hair and bright eyes, and\n",
      "a fearless, noble face. \"Surely here is a friend,\" he said to the swineherd. \"Thy dogs are\n",
      "not barking, but jump up and fawn on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The swineherd looked, and when he saw his young master he wept for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I should never see thee more, sweet light of my eyes,\" he said. \"Come into my hut,\n",
      "that I may gladden my heart with the sight of thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then spread before him the best he had, and the three men ate together. Although Odysseus\n",
      "seemed only a poor, ragged, old beggar, Telemachus treated him with such gentleness and such\n",
      "courtesy that Odysseus was proud and glad of his noble son. Soon Telemachus sent the swineherd\n",
      "to tell Penelope of his safe return, and while he was gone Athene entered the hut. She made\n",
      "herself invisible to Telemachus, but beckoned to Odysseus to go outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The time is come for thee to tell thy son who thou art,\" she said, and touched him with her\n",
      "golden wand.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once Odysseus was again a strong man, dressed in fine robes, and radiant and beautiful as\n",
      "the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he went back into the hut Telemachus thought he was a god.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No god am I,\" said Odysseus; \"I am thy father, Telemachus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus took his son in his arms and kissed him, and the tears that he had kept back until\n",
      "now ran down his cheeks. Telemachus flung his arms round his father's neck, and he, too, wept\n",
      "like a little child, so glad was he that Odysseus had come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "All day they spoke of the wooers and plotted how to slay them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the swineherd returned, and Athene had once more changed Odysseus into an old beggar-man,\n",
      "he told Telemachus that the wooers had returned, and were so furious with Telemachus for escaping\n",
      "from them, that they were going to kill him next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this Telemachus smiled to his father, but neither said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning Telemachus took his spear and said to the swineherd:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I go to the palace to see my mother. As for this old beggar-man, lead him to the city, that\n",
      "he may beg there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus, still pretending to be a beggar, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is better to beg in the town than in the fields. My garments are very poor and thin, and\n",
      "this frosty air chills me; but as soon as I am warmed at the fire and the sun grows hot, I\n",
      "will gladly set out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down the hill to the city strode Telemachus. When he came to the palace, his old nurse, whom\n",
      "he found busy in the hall, wept for joy. And when Penelope heard his voice, she came from her\n",
      "room and cast her arms round him and kissed his face and his eyes, and said, while tears ran\n",
      "down her cheeks:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art come, sweet light of my eyes. I thought I should never see thee more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Telemachus, looking like a young god, with his spear in his hand and his two hounds following\n",
      "at his heels, went to the hall where the wooers sat. To his friend Mentor he told his adventures,\n",
      "but he looked on the wooers with silence and scorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Odysseus and the swineherd followed him to the city. A beggar's bag, all tattered, was\n",
      "slung round the shoulders of Odysseus. In his hand he carried a staff. Men who saw him, tattered\n",
      "and feeble, mocked at him and his guide. But Odysseus kept down the anger in his heart, and\n",
      "they went on to the palace. Near the doorway, lying in the dirt, thin and old and rough of\n",
      "coat, lay Argos, the dog that long ago had been the best and fleetest that had hunted the hares\n",
      "and deer with Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard his master's voice he wagged his tail and tried to crawl near him. But he was\n",
      "too feeble to move. He could only look up with loving, wistful eyes that were almost blind,\n",
      "and thump his tail gladly. So glad was he that his faithful heart broke for joy, and before\n",
      "Odysseus could pat his head or speak a kind word to him, old Argos rolled over dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were tears in the eyes of Odysseus as he walked past the body of his friend. He sat down\n",
      "on the threshold leaning on his staff, and when Telemachus sent him bread and meat from his\n",
      "table he ate hungrily. When the meal was over he went round the hall begging from the wooers.\n",
      "Some gave him scraps of broken meats, others called him hard names and bade him begone, and\n",
      "one of them seized a footstool and struck him with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Odysseus still kept down the anger in his heart, and went back to his seat on the threshold\n",
      "with his beggar's bag full of the scraps that had been given to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he sat there, a common beggar, well known for his greed and impudence, came to the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get thee hence, old man,\" said he to Odysseus, \"else I shall knock all thy teeth from thy head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "More, too, he said, rudely and roughly, and at last he struck Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus could bear no more, and smote him such a blow on his neck that the bones were\n",
      "broken, and he fell on the ground with blood gushing from his mouth. Odysseus dragged him outside\n",
      "by the heels, and propped him, with his staff in his hands, against the courtyard wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit there,\" he said, \"and scare off dogs and swine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wooers laughed and enjoyed the sport, and gave gifts of food to the sturdy old beggar,\n",
      "as they took Odysseus to be. All evening they feasted and drank, but when night fell they went\n",
      "to their own homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were gone Odysseus and Telemachus carried all the helmets and swords and sharp-pointed\n",
      "spears that stood in the hall, away to the armory and hid them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Telemachus went to his room to rest, but Odysseus sat in the hall where the servants were\n",
      "clearing away the remains of the feast. While he sat there, Penelope came with her maids and\n",
      "rested on a chair In front of the glowing wood fire on which the servants had piled fresh logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She talked kindly and gently to the old beggar-man, and bade the old nurse bring water to wash\n",
      "his weary feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, once long ago, a wild boar that he hunted had torn the leg of Odysseus with his tusk,\n",
      "and as the old nurse washed his feet she saw the scar. In a moment she knew her master, and\n",
      "cried out. The brazen bath fell with a clang on the floor, and the water was spilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art Odysseus,\" she said; \"I did not know thee, my dear child, until I found the scar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Penelope must have heard her glad cry, had not Athene at that moment made her deep in thoughts\n",
      "of other things. Quickly Odysseus bade the old nurse be silent, and the old woman obeyed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Penelope went to rest she said sadly to Odysseus: \"I feel that the end is drawing near.\n",
      "Soon I shall be parted from the house of Odysseus. My husband, who was always the best and\n",
      "bravest, used to set up the twelve axes ye see standing here, and between each axe he shot\n",
      "an arrow. I have told the wooers that I shall marry whichever one of them can do the like.\n",
      "Then I shall leave this house, which must be for ever most dear to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then answered the old beggar-man: \"Odysseus will be here when they shoot. It will be Odysseus\n",
      "who shoots between the axes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Penelope, longing for his words to be true, went up to her room and lay crying on her bed until\n",
      "her pillows were wet. Then Athene sent sleep upon her eyelids and made her forget all her sorrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odysseus, too, would have tossed all night wide awake, with a heart full of anger and revenge,\n",
      "had not Athene gently laid her hands on his eyes and made him fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day the wooers came to the palace, and with rough jest and rude word they greeted Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who harms this man must fight with me,\" said Telemachus, and at that the wooers shouted with\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a stranger who sat among them cried out in a voice of fear:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see your hands and knees shrouded in blackness! I see your cheeks wet with tears! The walls\n",
      "and the pillars drip blood; the porch is full of shadows, and pale ghosts are hastening out\n",
      "of the gray mist that fills the palace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the wooers laughed the more, for they thought the man was mad. But, as in a dream,\n",
      "he had seen truly what was to come to pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeping, Penelope then brought forth from the armory the great bow with which Odysseus had\n",
      "shot in years that were past. Her heart was full of love for Odysseus, and she could not bear\n",
      "to wed another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Telemachus then threw aside his red cloak and ranged out the bronze axes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one the wooers tried to move the great bow and make it drive a swift arrow before it.\n",
      "One by one they failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when it seemed as if no man there was strong enough to move it, Odysseus took it in his\n",
      "hands, and between each axe he shot an arrow. When the last arrow was shot he tore off his\n",
      "rags, and in a voice that rang through the palace he cried to Telemachus: \"Now is it time to\n",
      "prepare supper for the wooers! Now, at last, is this terrible trial ended. I go to shoot at\n",
      "another mark!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he shot an arrow at the wooer who had ever been the most insolent and the most cruel.\n",
      "It smote him in the throat, his blood dripped red on the ground, and he fell dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others gave a great cry of rage, but Odysseus looked at them with burning eyes, and with\n",
      "a voice that made them tremble he cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye dogs! ye said I should never return, and, like the traitors ye are, ye have wasted my goods\n",
      "and insulted my queen. But now death has come for you, and none shall escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did the cowards, their faces pale with fear, beg for mercy. Mercy there was none that\n",
      "day. It was useless for those who drew their swords and rushed on Odysseus to try to slay him,\n",
      "for ere their swords could touch him, his bow had driven sharp arrows into their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the servants of the palace treacherously climbed into the armory and brought spears\n",
      "and shields and helmets for the wooers. But even that did not daunt Odysseus and his son. Telemachus,\n",
      "with his spear, slew man after man. When his arrows were done Odysseus also snatched a spear,\n",
      "and they fought side by side. Beside them fought the swineherd and one other man, and they\n",
      "all fought the more fearlessly because, all the time, Athene put fresh courage in their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were four men to very many others when that fight began. When it was ended the floor\n",
      "ran with blood, and Odysseus, like a lion at bay, stood with the dead bodies of the wooers\n",
      "piled in heaps around him and his face and hands stained with blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all lay dead, the old nurse gave a great cry of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rejoice in thy heart, old nurse,\" said Odysseus. \"It is an unholy thing to rejoice openly\n",
      "over slain men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nurse hastened to Penelope's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Penelope, dear child!\" she cried, \"Odysseus is come home, and all the wooers lie dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Penelope would not believe her. Too good did it seem to be true. Even when she came\n",
      "down and saw Odysseus leaning against a tall pillar in the light of the fire, she would not\n",
      "believe what her own eyes saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely, mother, thy heart is as hard as stone,\" said Telemachus. \"Dost thou not know my father?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Penelope saw only a ragged beggar-man, soiled with the blood of the men he had slain, old\n",
      "and ugly and poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Athene shed her grace upon Odysseus, and once more he was tall and strong and gallant\n",
      "to look upon, with golden hair curling like hyacinth flowers around his head. And Penelope\n",
      "ran to him and threw out her arms, and they held each other close and wept together like those\n",
      "who have suffered shipwreck, and have been tossed for long by angry seas, and yet have won\n",
      "safely home at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the sun went down that night on the little rocky island of Ithaca in the far seas,\n",
      "the heart of Odysseus was glad, for he knew that his wanderings were ended. Though he never\n",
      "even saw the sea till he was quite a big boy, he had always wanted to be a sailor, and to go\n",
      "away in a ship to visit strange, foreign, far-off lands; and he thought that if he could only\n",
      "do that, he would be quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his father wanted him to be a lawyer, and he often talked to Robinson, and told him of\n",
      "the terrible things that might happen to him if he went away, and how people who stopped at\n",
      "home were always the happiest. He told him, too, how Robinson's brother had gone away, and\n",
      "had been killed in the wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Robinson promised at last that he would give up wanting to be a sailor. But in a few days\n",
      "the longing came back as bad as ever, and he asked his mother to try to coax his father to\n",
      "let him go just one voyage. But his mother was very angry, and his father said, \"If he goes\n",
      "abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born. I can give no consent to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson stopped at home for another year, till he was nineteen years old, all the time thinking\n",
      "and thinking of the sea. But one day when he had gone on a visit to Hull, a big town by the\n",
      "sea, to say good-by to one of his friends who was going to London, he could not resist the\n",
      "chance. Without even sending a message to his father and mother, he went on board his friend's\n",
      "ship, and sailed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as soon as the wind began to blow and the waves to rise, poor Robinson was very frightened\n",
      "and seasick, and he said to himself that if ever he got on shore he would go straight home\n",
      "and never again leave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very solemn till the wind stopped blowing. His friend and the sailors laughed at him,\n",
      "and called him a fool, and he very soon forgot, when the weather was fine and the sun shining,\n",
      "all he had thought about going back to his father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in a few days, when the ship had sailed as far as Yarmouth Roads on her way to London,\n",
      "they had to anchor, and wait for a fair wind. In those days there were no steamers, and vessels\n",
      "had only their sails to help them along; so if it was calm, or the wind blew the wrong way,\n",
      "they had just to wait where they were till a fair wind blew.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they lay at Yarmouth the weather became very bad, and there was a great storm. The sea\n",
      "was so heavy and Robinson's ship was in such danger, that at last they had to cut away the\n",
      "masts in order to ease her and to stop her from rolling so terribly. The Captain fired guns\n",
      "to show that his ship wanted help. So a boat from another ship was lowered, and came with much\n",
      "difficulty and took off Robinson and all the crew, just before their vessel sank; and they\n",
      "got ashore at last, very wet and miserable, having lost all their clothes except what they had on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Robinson had some money in his pocket, and he went on to London by land, thinking that\n",
      "if he returned home now, people would laugh at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In London he made friends with a ship's captain, who had not long before come home from a voyage\n",
      "to the Guinea Coast, as that part of Africa was then called; and the Captain was so pleased\n",
      "with the money he had made there, that he easily persuaded Robinson to go with him on his next\n",
      "voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Robinson took with him toys, and beads, and other things, to sell to the natives in Africa,\n",
      "and he got there, in exchange for these things, so much gold-dust that he thought he was soon\n",
      "going in that way to make his fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore he went on a second voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this time he was not so lucky, for before they reached the African coast, one morning,\n",
      "very early, they sighted another ship, which they were sure was a pirate. So fast did this\n",
      "other vessel sail, that before night she had come up to Robinson's ship, which did not carry\n",
      "nearly so many men nor so many guns as the pirate, and which therefore did not want to fight;\n",
      "and the pirates soon took prisoner Robinson and all the crew of his ship who were not killed,\n",
      "and made slaves of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pirate captain took Robinson as his own slave, and made him dig in his garden and work\n",
      "in his house. Sometimes, too, he made him look after his ship when she was in port, but he\n",
      "never took him away on a voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two years Robinson lived like this, very unhappy, and always thinking how he might escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, when the Captain happened one time to be at home longer than usual, he began to go\n",
      "out fishing in a boat two or three times a week, taking Robinson, who was a very good fisher,\n",
      "and a black boy named Xury, with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he gave Robinson orders to put food and water, and some guns, and powder and shot,\n",
      "on a big boat that the pirates had taken out of an English ship, and to be ready to go with\n",
      "him and some of his friends on a fishing trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the last moment the Captain's friends could not come, and so Robinson was told to go\n",
      "out in the boat with one of the Captain's servants who was not a slave, and with Xury, to catch\n",
      "fish for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson thought that his chance to escape had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke to the servant, who was not very clever, and persuaded him to put more food and water\n",
      "on the boat, for, said Robinson, \"we must not take what was meant for our master.\" And then\n",
      "he got the servant to bring some more powder and shot, because, Robinson said, they might as\n",
      "well kill some birds to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had gone out about a mile, they hauled down the sail and began to fish. But Robinson\n",
      "pretended that he could not catch anything there, and he said that they ought to go further\n",
      "out. When they had gone so far that nobody on shore could see what they were doing, Robinson\n",
      "again pretended to fish. But this time he watched his chance, and when the servant was not\n",
      "looking, came behind him and threw him overboard, knowing that the man could swim so well that\n",
      "he could easily reach the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson sailed away with Xury down the coast to the south. He did not know to what country\n",
      "he was steering, but cared only to get away from the pirates, and to be free once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long days and nights they sailed, sometimes running in close to the land, but they were afraid\n",
      "to go ashore very often, because of the wild beasts and the natives. Many times they saw great\n",
      "lions come roaring down on to the beach, and once Robinson shot one that he saw lying asleep,\n",
      "and took its skin to make a bed for himself on the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, after some weeks, when they had got south as far as the great cape that is called\n",
      "Cape Verde, they saw a Portuguese vessel, which took them on board. It was not easy for Robinson\n",
      "to tell who he was, because he could not talk Portuguese, but everybody was very kind to him,\n",
      "and they bought his boat and his guns and everything that he had. They even bought poor Xury,\n",
      "who, of course, was a black slave, and could be sold just like a horse or a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when they got to Brazil, where the vessel was bound, Robinson had enough money to buy a\n",
      "plantation; and he grew sugar and tobacco there for four years, and was very happy and contented\n",
      "for a time, and made money.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he could never be contented for very long. So when some of his neighbors asked him if he\n",
      "would go in a ship to the Guinea Coast to get slaves for them, he went, only making a bargain\n",
      "that he was to be paid for his trouble, and to get some of the slaves to work on his plantation\n",
      "when he came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve days after the ship sailed, a terrible storm blew, and they were driven far from where\n",
      "they wanted to go. Great, angry, foaming seas broke over the deck, sweeping everything off\n",
      "that could be moved, and a man and a boy were carried overboard and drowned. No one on the\n",
      "ship expected to be saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "This storm was followed by another, even worse. The wind howled and roared through the rigging,\n",
      "and the weather was thick with rain and flying spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then early one morning land was dimly seen through the driving rain, but almost at once the\n",
      "vessel struck on a sand-bank. In an instant the sails were blown to bits, and flapped with\n",
      "such uproar that no one could hear the Captain's orders. Waves poured over the decks, and the\n",
      "vessel bumped on the sand so terribly that the masts broke off near the deck, and fell over\n",
      "the side into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "With great difficulty the only boat left on the ship was put in the water, and everybody got\n",
      "into her. They rowed for the shore, hoping to get perhaps into some bay, or to the mouth of\n",
      "a river, where the sea would be quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before they could reach the land, a huge gray wave, big like the side of a house, came\n",
      "foaming and thundering up behind them, and before any one could even cry out, it upset the\n",
      "boat, and they were all left struggling in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson was a very good swimmer, but no man could swim in such a sea, and it was only good\n",
      "fortune that brought him at last safely to land. Big wave after big wave washed him further\n",
      "and further up the beach, rolling him over and over, once leaving him helpless, and more than\n",
      "half drowned, beside a rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before the next wave could come up, perhaps to drag him back with it into the sea, he was\n",
      "able to jump up and run for his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he got safely out of the reach of the water, and lay down upon the grass. But of all\n",
      "on board the ship, Robinson was the only one who was not drowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "ROBINSON WORKS HARD AT MAKING HIMSELF A HOME\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had rested a little, Robinson got up and began to walk about very sadly, for darkness\n",
      "was coming on; he was wet, and cold, and hungry, and he did not know where to sleep, because\n",
      "he was afraid of wild beasts coming out of the woods and killing him during the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found that he still had his knife in his pocket, so he cut a big stick to protect himself\n",
      "with. Then he climbed into a tree which had very thick leaves, and there he fixed himself among\n",
      "the branches as well as he could, and fell sound asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning when he awoke, the storm was past, and the sea quieter. To his surprise, he\n",
      "saw that the ship had been carried in the night, by the great seas, much nearer to the shore\n",
      "than she had been when the boat left her, and was now lying not far from the rock where Robinson\n",
      "had first been washed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "By midday the sea was quite calm, and the tide had gone so far out that he could walk very\n",
      "near to the ship. So he took off his clothes and swam the rest of the way to her. But it was\n",
      "not easy to get on board, because the ship was resting on the sand, and lay so high out of\n",
      "the water that Robinson could not reach anything by which he could pull himself up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, after swimming twice round the vessel, he saw a rope hanging over, near the bow, and\n",
      "by its help he climbed on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in the stern of the ship was dry, and in pretty good order, and the water had not\n",
      "hurt the provisions much. So he took some biscuits, and ate them as he looked about, and drank\n",
      "some rum, and then he felt better, and stronger, and more fit to begin work.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, he took a few large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two, that were on the\n",
      "deck. These he pushed overboard, tying each with a rope to keep it from drifting away. Then\n",
      "he went over the side of the ship, and tied all the spars together so as to make a raft, and\n",
      "on top he put pieces of plank across. But it was long before he could make the raft fit to\n",
      "carry the things he wanted to take on shore.\n",

      "At last, after much hard work, he got on to it three of the seamen's chests, which he had broken\n",
      "open, and emptied, and he filled these with bread, and rice, and cheese, and whatever he could\n",
      "find to eat, and with all sorts of things that he thought he might need. He found, too, the\n",
      "carpenter's tool-chest, and put it on the raft; and nothing on the whole ship was of more use\n",
      "to him than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he set about looking for clothes, for while he had been on the ship, the tide had risen\n",
      "and had washed away his coat and waistcoat and shirt, which he had left lying on the sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guns and pistols also, and powder and shot, he took, and two rusty old cutlasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the trouble was to reach land, for the raft had no mast nor sail nor rudder, and was too\n",
      "heavy and clumsy to be pulled by Robinson with the broken oars that he had found. But the tide\n",
      "was rising, and slowly she drifted nearer and nearer, and at last was carried up the mouth\n",
      "of a little river which Robinson had not seen when he was on shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a strong tide running up, which once carried the raft against a point of land, where\n",
      "she stuck for a time, and very nearly upset all the things into deep water. But as the tide\n",
      "rose higher, Robinson was able to push her into a little bay where the water was shallow and\n",
      "the ground beneath flat, and when the tide went out there she was left high and dry, and he\n",
      "got everything safely ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing that Robinson did was to climb a hill, that he might see what sort of country\n",
      "he was in, and find out if there were any other people in it. But when he got to the top, he\n",
      "saw to his sorrow that he was on an island, with no other land in sight except some rocks,\n",
      "and two smaller islands far over the sea. There were no signs of any people, and he saw nothing\n",
      "living except great numbers of birds, one of which he shot. But it was not fit to eat, being\n",
      "some kind of hawk.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, with the chests and boards that he had brought on shore, he made a kind of hut\n",
      "to sleep in that night, and he lay there on the sand very comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day by day now for some time Robinson swam out to the ship, and made fresh rafts, loading them\n",
      "with many stores, powder and shot, and lead for bullets, seven muskets, a great barrel of bread,\n",
      "three casks of rum, a quantity of flour, some grain, a box of sugar, sails and ropes and twine,\n",
      "bags of nails, and many hatchets. With one of the sails he made himself a good tent, in which\n",
      "he put everything that could be spoiled by rain or sun. Around it he piled all the casks and\n",
      "other heavy things, so that no wild beast could very easily get at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about a fortnight the weather changed; it blew very hard one night, and in the morning the\n",
      "ship had broken up, and was no more to be seen. But that did not so much matter, for Robinson\n",
      "had got out of her nearly everything that he could use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Robinson thought it time to find some better place for his tent. The land where it then\n",
      "stood was low and near the sea, and the only water he could get to drink tasted rather salt.\n",
      "Looking about, he found a little plain, about a hundred yards across, on the side of a hill,\n",
      "and at the end of the plain was a great rock partly hollowed out, but not so as quite to make\n",
      "a cave. Here he pitched his tent, close to the hollow place in the rock. Round in front of\n",
      "the tent he drove two rows of strong stakes, about eighteen inches apart, sharpened at top;\n",
      "and he made this fence so strong that when it was finished he was sure that nothing could get\n",
      "at him, for he left no door, but climbed in and out by a ladder, which he always hauled up\n",
      "after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before closing up the end, Robinson hauled inside this fence all his stores, his food and his\n",
      "guns, his powder and shot, and he rigged inside a double tent, so better to keep off the hot\n",
      "sun and the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began to dig into the rock, which was not very hard, and soon behind his tent he had\n",
      "a cave in which he thought it wise to stow his gunpowder, about one hundred and forty pounds\n",
      "in all, packed in small parcels; for, he thought, if a big thunderstorm were to come, a flash\n",
      "of lightning might explode it all, and blow him to bits, if he kept the whole of it in his tent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson was now very comfortable, and as he had saved from the wreck two cats and a dog, he\n",
      "did not feel quite so lonely. He had got, also, ink and pens and paper, so that he could keep\n",
      "a diary; and he set up a large wooden cross, on which he cut with his knife the date of his\n",
      "landing on the island--September 30, 1659; and every day he cut a notch on the post, with a\n",
      "longer one each Sunday, so that he might always know how the months and years passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for food, he found that there were many goats on the island, and numbers of pigeons, and\n",
      "he had no difficulty in shooting as many as he needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now he saw that his tent and cave were too small for all the things he had stowed in them,\n",
      "so he began to make the cave bigger, bringing out all the rock and soil that he cut down, and\n",
      "making with it a kind of terrace round the inside of his stockade. And as he was sure that\n",
      "there were no wild beasts on the island to harm him, he went on tunneling to the right hand\n",
      "till he broke through the rock outside his fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began to hang things up against the side of the cave, and he even made shelves, and\n",
      "a door for the outside entrance. This was a very difficult job, and took him a long time; for,\n",
      "to make a board, he was forced to cut down a whole tree, and chop away with his axe till one\n",
      "side was flat, and then cut at the other side till the board was thin enough, when he smoothed\n",
      "it with his adze. But in this way, out of each tree he would only get one plank. He made for\n",
      "himself also a table and a chair, and finally got his castle, as he called it, in very good order.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all his care, however, there was one thing that he forgot, and that was, when he had made\n",
      "the cave so much bigger, to prop it, so as to keep the roof from falling in. And so one day\n",
      "he got a terrible fright, and was nearly killed, by a huge bit of the soft rock which fell\n",
      "and buried many of his things. It took weeks of hard work afterwards to clear away the fallen\n",
      "rubbish, and to cut beams strong enough to prop the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, all this time, he used to climb up the hill and look around over the lonely waters,\n",
      "hoping, always hoping, that some morning he might see the sails of a ship that would take him\n",
      "home. But none ever came, and sometimes the tears ran down his cheeks because of the sorrow\n",
      "he felt at being so utterly alone. At times even, he thought in his misery that if he only\n",
      "had any kind of a boat, it would be better to sail away, and chance reaching other land, rather\n",
      "than to stop where he was. By and by, however, he grew less unhappy, for he had plenty of work\n",

      "\n",
      "Now about this time, when Robinson had been some months on the island, heavy and constant rain\n",
      "began to fall, and sometimes weeks would pass without a single dry day. He found that instead\n",
      "of there being spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as in England, the seasons in his island\n",
      "were divided into the wet and the dry. There was no cold weather, no winter. It chanced that\n",
      "just before this first rain began, Robinson had emptied out some refuse from bags which had\n",
      "once held rice, and other grain, and he had forgotten all about having emptied them. So he\n",
      "was very much astonished to find, some time afterwards, both barley and rice growing near his\n",
      "tent, in the shade of the rock. The ears, when ripe, he kept to sow again, and from this very\n",
      "small beginning, in the course of a few seasons, he had a great quantity of grain, both for\n",
      "food and for sowing. But this meant every year much hard work, for he had no plow nor harrow,\n",
      "and all the ground had to be dug with a clumsy spade, made from a very hard, heavy wood that\n",
      "grew on the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Robinson could not grind the grain that he grew, nor make bread from it. If he could\n",
      "have found a large stone, slightly hollow on top, he might, by pounding the grain on it with\n",
      "another round stone, have made very good meal. But all the stones he could find were too soft,\n",
      "and in the end he had to make a sort of mill of hard wood, in which he burnt a hollow place,\n",
      "and on that he pounded the grain into meal with a heavy stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baking he did by building a big fire, then raking away the ashes, and putting the dough on\n",
      "the hot place, covered with a kind of basin made of clay, over which he heaped the red ashes.\n",
      "In this way very good bread can be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the rainy season was over, and just after he had finished the fence round his tent,\n",
      "one day when Robinson was at work in the cave, all of a sudden the earth began to fall from\n",
      "the roof, and the strong props he had put in cracked in a way which frightened him terribly.\n",
      "At the same time there was a curious moaning, rumbling noise, that he could not understand.\n",
      "He rushed out, and so afraid was he that the roof was falling in, and that he should be buried,\n",
      "that he got over the fence and began to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was even more frightened when he found that all the ground was shaking. Then he knew\n",
      "that this was an earthquake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three times there came violent shocks; a huge rock about half a mile away fell with a great\n",
      "noise like thunder, and the sea was churned up as if by a whirlwind. Robinson was sick with\n",
      "the movement of the ground, and trembling with the dread of being swallowed by the earth as\n",
      "it cracked and gaped; and after the noise and shaking were over, he was too frightened to go\n",
      "back to his tent, but sat where he was, all the time expecting another shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a furious wind began to blow, tearing up trees by the roots, and lashing the water\n",
      "till nothing could be seen but foam and flying spray. The air was full of branches and leaves\n",
      "torn off by the hurricane, and birds in hundreds were swept helpless out to sea. In about three\n",
      "hours, as suddenly as it had begun, the wind fell, and there was a dead calm, followed by rain\n",
      "such as Robinson had never before seen, which soaked him to the skin, and forced him to return\n",
      "to the cave, where he sat in great fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For long after this he was very uneasy, and made up his mind to shift his quarters as soon\n",
      "as he could find a better place for his tent. But the earthquake had one good result, for what\n",
      "remained of the wreck was again thrown up by the sea, and Robinson got more things out of it\n",
      "which were useful to him, and for days he worked hard at that. One day, too, when he was on\n",
      "his way to the remains of the ship, he came on a large turtle, which he killed, and this gave\n",
      "him plenty of good food, for besides the flesh, there were, inside the animal, many eggs, which\n",
      "she had come to the shore to lay in the sand, as is the habit of turtles, and which Robinson\n",
      "thought were even better than hen's eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a few days after he had got so wet in the heavy rain, though the weather was hot, Robinson\n",
      "felt very cold and shivery, and had pains all over his body, and at night he dreamed terrible\n",
      "dreams. The following day, and many days, he lay very ill with fever and ague, and hardly knew\n",
      "what he was doing. So weak was he, that he believed he was dying, and there was no one to give\n",
      "him water to quench his thirst, nor to help him in any way. His only medicine was rum, in which\n",
      "he had soaked tobacco. It was very nasty, and made him sick, but it also made him sleep for\n",
      "more than a whole day and a night, and he woke much better, and able to walk about a little,\n",
      "though for a fortnight he was too weak to work. From this illness he learned not to go out\n",
      "more than he could help during the rainy season.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was again quite strong, Robinson started to explore the island better than he had yet\n",
      "done, and he found many things growing, of which he made great use afterwards, tobacco, sugar-cane,\n",
      "and all manner of fruits, among them grapes, which he used to dry to raisins in the sun in\n",
      "great quantities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the spot where the most fruit grew, he built a hut, and round it, for safety, he put a\n",
      "double fence made of stakes cut from some of the trees near at hand. During the next rainy\n",
      "season these stakes took root, and grew so fast that soon nothing of the hut could be seen\n",
      "from outside the hedge, and it made so good a hiding-place, that Robinson cut more stakes of\n",
      "the same kind, and planted them outside the fence around his first dwelling; and in a year\n",
      "or two that also was quite hidden from view. The twigs of this tree, too, were good for making\n",
      "baskets, of which he had been in great need.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished all this work, he started again to go over the rest of the island, and\n",
      "on his way across, from a hill, the day being very clear, he saw high land a great way off\n",
      "over the water, but whether it was another island, or the coast of America, he could not be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the other side of his island Robinson found the beach covered with turtles\n",
      "in astonishing numbers, and he thought how much better off he would have been if he had been\n",
      "cast ashore here, for not only would the turtles have supplied him with plenty of food, but\n",
      "there were far more birds than on the part of the island where he had been living, and far\n",
      "more goats.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the journey back to his castle he caught a young parrot, which, after a long time, he\n",
      "taught to speak and to call him by his name. It was so long since he had heard any voice, that\n",
      "it was a comfort to listen even to a parrot talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the sight which Robinson had had of the far distant land raised in him again the great\n",
      "longing to get away from this island where he had been so long alone, and he wished greatly\n",
      "for a boat. He went over to the remains of the boat in which he and the others had tried to\n",
      "come ashore when their ship struck on the sand-bank, and which had been flung far up on the\n",
      "beach by the sea, and he worked for weeks trying to repair her and to get her into the water.\n",
      "But it was all of no use; he could not move her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, he thought, \"I'll cut down a tree, and make a new boat.\" This he fancied would be easy,\n",
      "for he had heard how the Indians make canoes by felling a tree and burning out the inside.\n",
      "\"If they can do it, then surely I can do it even better,\" he thought. So he looked about, and\n",
      "chose a huge tree which stood about a hundred yards from the water, and with great labor in\n",
      "about three weeks he had cut it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months Robinson worked at this boat, thinking all the time of what he would do when he\n",
      "reached the far distant land, and much pleased with himself for the beautiful boat he was making.\n",
      "Day after day he trimmed and shaped it, and very proud he was when it was finished and lay\n",
      "there on the ground, big enough to carry twenty men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he started to get her into the water. But that was quite another thing. By no means in\n",
      "his power could he move her an inch, try as he might. She was far too big. Then he began to\n",
      "dig a canal from the sea to the boat; but before he had got much of that work done, he saw\n",
      "clearly that there was so much earth to dig away, that, without some one to help him, it must\n",
      "take years and years before he could get the water to the boat. So he gave it up, and left\n",

      "\n",
      "By the time that Robinson had been four years on the island, all his clothes had become very\n",
      "ragged, and he had hardly anything that could be called a hat. Clothes he must have, for he\n",
      "could not go naked without getting his skin blistered by the hot sun, and he was afraid of\n",
      "getting a sunstroke if he went about without a hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he had kept all the skins of the goats, and other animals, such as hares and foxes, that\n",
      "he had shot; and from these, after many failures, at last he made a hat and coat of goatskin,\n",
      "and a pair of short trousers, all with the hair outside, so as to shoot off the wet when it\n",
      "rained. The hat was very tall, and came to a sharp peak on top, and it had a flap which hung\n",
      "down the back of his neck. Robinson also, with much trouble, made of the skins an umbrella\n",
      "which he could open and shut; and if his clothes and his umbrella, and especially his hat,\n",
      "were not very good to look at, they were useful, and he could now go about in any weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next five years nothing out of the common happened, and Robinson's time was mostly\n",
      "taken up with the getting of food, the yearly sowing and reaping of his crops, and the curing\n",
      "of his raisins. But towards the end of that time he made another attempt to build a boat, and\n",
      "this time he made one much smaller than the first, and though it took him nearly two years\n",
      "to finish, in the end he got her into the sea. She was not big enough for him to try to sail\n",
      "in to the far-off land that he had seen, and he used her only for cruising about the shores\n",
      "of his own island, and for fishing. In her he fixed a little mast, on which he rigged a small\n",
      "sail, made from a bit of one of the old ship's sails, and, using a paddle to steer with, he\n",
      "found that she sailed very well. Over the stern he fixed his big umbrella, to shade him from\n",
      "the sun, like an awning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eager to go all round the island, one day Robinson put a lot of food on board, and, taking\n",
      "his gun, started on a voyage. All went well till he came to the east end of the island, where\n",
      "he found that a ledge of rocks, and beyond that a sand-bank, stretched out to sea for eight\n",
      "or nine miles. Robinson did not like the idea of venturing so far in a boat so small, and he\n",
      "therefore ran the boat ashore, and climbed a hill, to get a good view of the rocks and shoals\n",
      "before going near them. From the hill, he saw that a strong current was sweeping past the sand-bank,\n",
      "which showed just clear of the water, and on which the sea was breaking; but he thought there\n",
      "was an eddy which would swing him safely round the point, without bringing him near the breakers.\n",
      "However, that day and the next, there was a good deal of wind blowing in the direction contrary\n",
      "to the current, which, of course, raised a sea too big for a small boat, so Robinson stopped\n",
      "on shore where he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day it was calm, and he set off. But no sooner had he come abreast of the sand-bank\n",
      "than he found himself in very deep water, with a current running like a mill-race, which carried\n",
      "the boat further and further away from the land, in spite of all that he could do with his\n",
      "paddle. There was no wind, and the sail was useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he gave himself up for lost, for the harder he worked, only the further away seemed the\n",
      "boat to be swept. The island was soon so far off that Robinson could hardly see it, and he\n",
      "was quite exhausted with the hard struggle to paddle the boat against the current. He was in\n",
      "despair, and giving up paddling, left the boat to drift where she would. Just then a faint\n",
      "puff of wind touched his cheek, and Robinson hurriedly hoisted his sail. Soon a good breeze\n",
      "blew, which carried him past a dangerous reef of rocks. Here the current seemed to divide,\n",
      "the part in which he now was began to swing round towards the island, and he plucked up heart\n",
      "again, and with his paddle did all he could to help the sail. Robinson felt like a man who\n",
      "is set free after he has been told that he must die; he could almost have wept for joy. Miles\n",
      "and miles he sailed, steadily getting nearer to the land, and late in the evening at last he\n",
      "got ashore, but on the other side of the point that he had tried to round in the morning. He\n",
      "drew up his boat on the shore of a little cove that he found, and when he had made her fast,\n",
      "so that the tide could not carry her away, there among the trees he lay down, and slept sound,\n",
      "quite worn out.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning he again got on board, and coasted along close inshore, till he came to a bay\n",
      "with a little river running into it, which made a very good harbor for the boat. Here he left\n",
      "her, and went on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he found that he was not far from a spot that he had once before visited, and by afternoon\n",
      "he arrived at the hut which he called his country-house. Robinson got over the fence by the\n",
      "ladder, as usual, pulling it up after him, and then he lay down to rest in the shade, for he\n",
      "was still very weary from the hard work of the day before. Soon he fell asleep. But what was\n",
      "his surprise in a little time to be awakened by a voice calling, \"Robin! Robin Crusoe! where\n",
      "are you?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "no sooner had he risen than he saw, sitting on the tree near to him, his parrot, which must\n",
      "have flown all the way from Robinson's other house, where it had been left. It was talking\n",
      "away at a great rate, very excited at again seeing its master, and Robinson hardly knew whether\n",
      "to be more relieved or disappointed that it was only the bird that had called him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For about a year after this Robinson kept to his own side of the island, and employed his time\n",
      "chiefly in working on his land, and in making dishes and pots of clay. These he had now learned\n",
      "to burn properly. Pipes, too, he made, and they were a great comfort to him, for he managed\n",
      "to cure very good tobacco from the wild plants that grew around. And as he feared lest his\n",
      "powder might begin to run short, he thought much over ways whereby he could trap goats for\n",
      "food, instead of shooting them. After many trials, the best plan, he decided, was to dig holes,\n",
      "which he covered with thin branches and leaves, on which he sprinkled earth, so that when anything\n",
      "heavy passed over, it must fall into the pit. By this means he caught many, and the kids he\n",
      "kept and tamed, so that in no great time he had quite a large herd of goats. These he kept\n",
      "in various small fields, round which from time to time he had put fences. This time, however,\n",
      "when he got to the hill from which he had watched the set of the current the day that he had\n",
      "been carried out to sea, he noticed that there was no current to be seen, from which he concluded\n",
      "that it must depend on the ebb and flow of the tide. Still, he was afraid to venture far in\n",
      "the canoe, though he stopped some time at his country-house, and went out sailing very often.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day when Robinson was walking along the sand towards his boat, suddenly, close to the water,\n",
      "he stopped as if he had been shot, and, with thumping heart, stood staring in wonder and fear\n",
      "at something that he saw. The mark of a naked foot on the sand! It could not be his own, he\n",
      "knew, for the shape was quite different. Whose could it be?\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened, he looked about, but nothing could he hear or see. To the top of a rising ground\n",
      "he ran, and looked all around. There was nothing to be seen. And though he searched everywhere\n",
      "on the beach for more footmarks, he found none.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose footprint could it be? That of some man, perhaps, he thought, who might come stealing\n",
      "on him out from the trees, or murder him while he slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to his house he hurried, all the way in a state of terror, starting every now and again\n",
      "and facing round, thinking he was being followed, and fancying often that a stump or a bush\n",
      "was a man, waiting to spring on him. That night he slept not at all, and so shaken was his\n",
      "nerve that every cry of a night-bird, even every sound made by an insect or a frog, caused\n",
      "him to start with fear, so that the perspiration ran down his brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As day followed day, however, and nothing happened, Robinson began to be less uneasy in his\n",
      "mind, and went about his usual work again. But he strengthened the fence round his castle,\n",
      "and cut in it seven small loopholes, in which, fixed on frames, he placed loaded muskets, all\n",
      "ready to fire if he should be attacked. And some distance from the outside of the fence he\n",
      "planted a thick belt of small stakes, so that in a few years' time a perfect thicket of trees\n",
      "and bushes hid all trace of his dwelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years passed quietly, and nothing further happened to disturb Robinson, or to make him think\n",
      "more of the footprint that had frightened him so much. But he kept more than formerly to the\n",
      "interior of the island, and lost no chance of looking for good places to hide in, if he should\n",
      "ever need them. And he always carried a cutlass now, as well as his gun and a couple of pistols.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day it chanced, however, that he had gone further to the west of the island than he had\n",
      "ever done before, and, looking over the sea, he fancied that he saw, at a great distance, something\n",
      "like a boat or a long canoe, but it was so far off that he he could not be sure what it was.\n",
      "This made him determine that always in future he would bring with him to his lookout-place\n",
      "the telescope which he had saved from the wreck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of this supposed boat brought back his uneasiness to some extent, but he went on\n",
      "down to the beach, and there he saw a sight which filled him with horror. All about the shore\n",
      "were scattered men's skulls and bones, and bits of burnt flesh, and in one place were the remains\n",
      "of a big fire. Robinson stood aghast, feeling deadly sick. It was easy for him to know the\n",
      "meaning of the terrible sight. It meant that cannibals had been there, killing and eating their\n",
      "prisoners; for when the natives of some parts of the world go to war, and catch any of their\n",
      "enemies, it is their habit to build a fire, then to kill the prisoners and feast on their roasted\n",
      "bodies, eating till they can eat no more. Sometimes, if the man they are going to eat is too\n",
      "thin, they keep him, and feed him up, till they think he is fat enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Robinson knew all this, though he had never yet met any cannibals. And when he looked around\n",
      "he saw many bones lying about. They were so old that it seemed certain to him that all those\n",
      "years he had been living on an island which was a regular place for the natives to come to\n",
      "for such feasts. Then he saw what a mercy it was that he had been wrecked on the other side\n",
      "of the island, to which, he supposed, the cannibals never came, because the beach was not so\n",
      "good for them to land on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of horror, Robinson hurried back to his house, and for almost two years he never again\n",
      "came near that part of the island where the bones lay, nor ever visited his boat. But all the\n",
      "time he kept thinking how he might some day kill those cannibals while they were at their feast,\n",
      "and perhaps save some of the poor men whom they had not yet killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now one day when Robinson was down in the bottom of the valley, cutting thick branches to burn\n",
      "for charcoal, he cleared away some undergrowth at the foot of a great rock, in which, near\n",
      "the ground, there was a sort of hole, or opening. Into this hole Robinson squeezed, not very\n",
      "easily, and found himself in a cave of good size, high enough, at least, to stand up in. It\n",
      "was quite dark, of course, to him coming in from the sunlight, and he turned his back to the\n",
      "entrance to feel his way further in, when suddenly, from the back of the cave he saw two great\n",
      "fiery eyes glaring at him. His very hair bristled with fright, for he could only think that\n",
      "it must be the Devil at least that he saw; and through the mouth of the cave he fled with a yell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he got into the bright sunshine he began to feel ashamed of his panic, and to reason\n",
      "with himself that what he had seen must be only his own fancy. So, taking up a big burning\n",
      "branch from his fire, in he went again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Robinson had taken three steps he stopped, in almost as great a fright as at first.\n",
      "Close to him he heard a great sigh, as if of some one in pain, then a sound like a muttering,\n",
      "as of words that he could not understand; again another deep sigh. Cold sweat broke out all\n",
      "over him, and he stepped back trembling, yet determined this time not to run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding his torch well over his head, he looked around, and there on the floor of the cave\n",
      "lay a huge old he goat, gasping for breath, dying, seemingly of mere old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stirred him with his toe to see if he could get him out of the cave, but the poor beast\n",
      "could not rise, and Robinson left him to die where he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he had got over his fright, Robinson looked carefully about him. The cave was small,\n",
      "not more than twelve feet across at its widest, but he noticed at the far end another opening.\n",
      "This was so low down, however, that he had to creep on his hands and knees to get in, and without\n",
      "a better light than the burning torch, he could not see how far it went. So he made up his\n",
      "mind to come again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson had long before this made a good supply of very fair candles from the tallow of the\n",
      "goats he had killed, and next day he returned to the cave with six of these, and his tinder-box\n",
      "to light them with. In those days there were no matches, and men used to strike a light with\n",
      "a flint and steel, and tinder, which was a stuff that caught fire very easily from a spark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering the cave, Robinson found, on lighting a candle, that the goat was now dead. Moving\n",
      "it aside, to be buried later, he went down on his hands and knees, and crawled about ten yards\n",
      "through the small passage, till at last he found himself in a great chamber, the roof of which\n",
      "was quite twenty feet high. On every side the walls reflected the light of his candle, and\n",
      "glittered like gold, or almost like diamonds, he thought. The floor was perfectly dry and level,\n",
      "even on the walls there was no damp, and Robinson was delighted with his discovery. Its only\n",
      "drawback was the low entrance; but, as he decided to use the cave chiefly as a place to retreat\n",
      "to if he should ever be attacked, that was in reality an advantage, because one man, if he\n",
      "had firearms could easily defend it against hundreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once Robinson set about storing in it all his powder, except three or four pounds, all his\n",
      "lead for making bullets, and his spare guns and muskets. When moving the powder, he thought\n",
      "he might as well open a barrel which had drifted ashore out of the wreck 'after the earthquake,\n",
      "and though water had got into it, there was not a great deal of damage done, for the powder\n",
      "had crusted on the outside only, and in the inside there was about sixty pounds weight, quite\n",
      "dry and good. This, with what remained of the first lot, gave him a very large supply, enough\n",
      "to last all his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more than two-and-twenty years Robinson had now been in the island, and he had grown quite\n",
      "used to it, and to his manner of living. If he could only have been sure that no savages would\n",
      "come near him, he felt almost that he would be content to spend all the rest of his days there,\n",
      "to die at last, as the goat he found in the cave had died, of old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "At times, when his spirits were more than usually low, when the burden of the lonely years\n",
      "pressed most heavily upon him, Robinson used to think that surely if the savages could come\n",
      "to his land, he could go to theirs. How far did they come? Where was their country? What kind\n",
      "of boats had they? And so eager to go was he sometimes, that he forgot to think of what he\n",
      "would do when he got there, or what would become of him if he fell into the hands of the savages.\n",
      "His mind was utterly taken up with the one thought of getting to the mainland, and even his\n",
      "dreams were of little else.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, when he had put himself almost into a fever with the trouble of his mind, he had\n",
      "lain long awake, tossing and moaning, but at last he had fallen asleep. And he dreamed, not\n",
      "as he had usually done of late, that he was sailing to the mainland, but that as he was leaving\n",
      "his castle in the morning he saw on the shore two canoes and eleven savages landing, and that\n",
      "they had with them another man, whom they were just about to kill and eat, when suddenly the\n",
      "prisoner jumped up and ran for his life. And in his dream Robinson fancied that the man came\n",
      "running to hide in the thicket round the castle, and that thereupon he went out to help him.\n",
      "Then in the dream, the savage kneeled down, as if begging for mercy, and Robinson took him\n",
      "over the ladder into the castle, saying to himself, \"Now that I've got this fellow, I can certainly\n",
      "go to the mainland, for he will show me what course to steer, and where to go when we land.\"\n",
      "And he woke, with the joyful feeling that now at last all was well. But when he was wide awake,\n",
      "and knew that it was only a dream after all, poor Robinson was more cast down than ever, and\n",
      "more unhappy than he had been during all the years he had lived on the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dream had, however, this result; that he saw his only plan to get away was, if possible,\n",
      "to rescue some day one of the prisoners whom the cannibals were about to kill, and in time\n",
      "get the man to help him to navigate his canoe across the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this idea, he set himself to watch, more closely than ever he had done before, for the\n",
      "savages to land, and during more than a year and a half he went nearly every day to his lookout-place,\n",
      "and swept the sea with his telescope, in the hope of seeing canoes coming. But none came, and\n",
      "Robinson was getting terribly tired of the constant watch. Still he did not give up, for he\n",
      "knew that sooner or later the savages would land again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet many months passed, and still they did not come, till one morning, very early, almost to\n",
      "his surprise, he saw no fewer than five canoes hauled up on the shore on his own side of the\n",
      "island. The savages who had come in them were nowhere to be seen. Now, he knew that always\n",
      "from four to six men came in each canoe, which meant that at least twenty, and perhaps as many\n",
      "as thirty men had landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a greater number than he cared to face, so he kept inside his castle, in great doubt\n",
      "what to do, but ready to fight, in case they should attack him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had waited a long time and still could hear nothing of the savages, he climbed up his\n",
      "ladder and got to the top of the rock, taking great care not to show himself against the skyline.\n",
      "Looking through his glass, he saw that there were at least thirty savages, dancing wildly round\n",
      "a fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he looked, some of the men left the others, and going over to the canoes dragged from' them\n",
      "two prisoners. One of these almost at once fell forward on his face, knocked down from behind,\n",
      "as it seemed to Robinson, with a wooden club, and two or three of the cannibals at once cut\n",
      "him open to be ready for cooking, while for a moment or two they left the other prisoner standing\n",
      "by himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing a chance of escape, the man made a dash for his life, running with tremendous speed\n",
      "along the sands straight for that part of the beach near Robinson's castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this alarmed Robinson very much, for it seemed to him that the whole of the savages started\n",
      "after the prisoner. He could not help thinking it likely that, as in his dream, this man would\n",
      "take shelter in the thicket round the castle, in which case Robinson was likely soon to have\n",
      "more fighting than he would relish, for the whole body of the cannibals would be on him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he watched the poor man racing for life, however, he was relieved to see that he ran much\n",
      "faster than his pursuers, of whom only three continued to run after him. If he could hold out\n",
      "for another mile or two there was little doubt that he would escape. Between the castle and\n",
      "the runners was the creek up which Robinson used to run his rafts from the wreck, and when\n",
      "the escaped prisoner came to that, he plunged in, and though the tide was full, with less than\n",
      "thirty powerful strokes he reached the other side, and with long easy strides continued his\n",
      "run. Of the men in pursuit, two also plunged in and swam through, but less quickly than the\n",
      "man escaping, being more blown with running, because of what they had eaten before starting.\n",
      "The third man stopped altogether, and went back the way he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the turn things were taking, it seemed to Robinson that now had come his chance to get\n",
      "a servant, and he resolved to try to save the life of the man who was fleeing from the cannibals.\n",
      "At once he hurried down the ladder, snatched up his two guns, and running as fast as he could,\n",
      "got between the man and his pursuers, calling out to him at the same time to stop. The man\n",
      "looked back, and the sight of Robinson seemed to frighten him at first as much as did the men\n",
      "who were trying to catch him. But Robinson again spoke, and signed to him with his hand to\n",
      "come back, and in the meantime went slowly towards the other men, who were now coming near.\n",
      "Then, rushing at the foremost, he knocked him senseless with the butt of his gun, for it seemed\n",
      "to him safer not to fire, lest the noise should bring the other cannibals around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second man, seeing his comrade fall, hesitated, and stopped, but Robinson saw when nearer\n",
      "to him that the savage had in his hands a bow and arrow with which he was just about to shoot.\n",
      "There was then no choice but to fire first, which Robinson did, killing the man on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the man who had been chased by the others was so terrified by the flash and noise\n",
      "of the gun, and at seeing his enemy fall dead, that he stood stock still, trembling, and it\n",
      "was with great difficulty that Robinson coaxed him to come near. This at last he did, stopping\n",
      "every few paces and kneeling down. At length, coming close to Robinson, he again knelt, kissed\n",
      "the ground, and taking hold of Robinson's foot, set it on his head as it rested on the sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this was going on, Robinson noticed that the savage whom he had knocked down had begun\n",
      "to move, and to come to his senses. To this he drew the attention of the man whom he had rescued,\n",
      "who said some words that Robinson could not understand, but which sounded pleasant to an ear\n",
      "that had heard no voice but his own for more than twenty-five years. Next he made a motion\n",
      "with his hand, as if asking for the cutlass that hung at Robinson's belt, and when the weapon\n",
      "was given to him he ran at his enemy, and with one clean blow cut off his head. Then, laughing,\n",
      "he brought the head, and laid it with the cutlass at Robinson's feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what caused most wonder to the man was how the savage whom Robinson shot had been killed\n",
      "at so great a distance, and he went to look as the body, turning it over and over, and looking\n",
      "long at the wound in the breast that the bullet had made, evidently much puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson then turned to go away, beckoning to the savage to follow, but the man made signs\n",
      "that he would bury the two bodies in the sand, so that the others might not find them if they\n",
      "followed. With his hands he soon scraped holes deep enough to cover the bodies, and in less\n",
      "than a quarter of an hour there was hardly a trace left of what had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling him away, Robinson now took him, not to his castle, but to the cave, where he gave\n",
      "him food and water; and then he made signs for him to lie down and rest, pointing to a bundle\n",
      "of rice straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the man was sound asleep. He was, Robinson thought, a handsome and well-made man; the\n",
      "muscles of his arms and back and legs showed great strength, and all his limbs were beautifully\n",
      "formed. As near as Robinson could guess, he was about twenty-six years of age, with a good\n",
      "and manly face, and long black hair. His nose and lips were like those of a European, and his\n",
      "teeth were white and even. In color he was not black, but of a sort of rich chocolate brown,\n",
      "the skin shining with health, and pleasant to look upon. First he made him understand that\n",
      "his name was to be \"Friday\" (that being the day of the week when Robinson had saved him from\n",
      "a horrible death). Then he taught him the meaning of \"Yes,\" and \"No,\" and to call Robinson\n",
      "\"Master.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday showed great quickness in learning. He seemed to be happy and contented, and free from\n",
      "trouble, except that the clothes which Robinson made him wear gave him at first great discomfort,\n",
      "for in those warm parts of the world the natives are not used to clothes, but always go about\n",
      "naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day following that on which Robinson had saved Friday, they went out together to see if\n",
      "there were any signs of the cannibals still being on the island, but it was evident that they\n",
      "had gone away without troubling about the two men whom Robinson had killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time Robinson did not trust Friday, and did not allow him to sleep in the same part\n",
      "of his castle with himself, but kept him at night in a little tent outside the fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday was quite faithful, never sulky nor lazy, but always merry, and ready to do anything\n",
      "that Robinson told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first when they went out in the woods together, Friday was terrified each time that Robinson's\n",
      "gun was fired. He had never seen anything like it, and it was more than he could understand\n",
      "how things could be killed merely by the noise and the flash of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday told Robinson much about his country, and about his people, who he said were Caribs.\n",
      "And a great way \"beyond the moon,\" by which he meant to the west, he said that white men lived\n",
      "who had beards such as Robinson wore. These white men, he said, had killed very many natives,\n",
      "from which Robinson fancied that they must be Spaniards, who about that time were very cruel\n",
      "to the people whose countries they had taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson asked if Friday could tell him how he might get over to where the white men lived,\n",
      "and Friday said it would be very easy, if they had a big canoe, and again Robinson began to\n",
      "make plans and to hope to escape from the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time after this Robinson and Friday chanced to be on the high hill at the east end of\n",
      "the island. The day was very clear. Friday gazed long over the sea, and then began to jump\n",
      "and dance, pointing to the dim blue coast. \"There my country! See! There my people live!\" he\n",
      "said, his eyes sparkling with joy, and an eager light on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, for a time Robinson was not easy in his mind about Friday. He had little doubt\n",
      "that if he could get back to his tribe, he would soon forget all he had been taught, might\n",
      "even return with a hundred or two of his friends, and kill and eat his master. But in this\n",
      "Robinson was very unjust to Friday, who had no such thoughts in his mind as those of which\n",
      "he was suspected. And this Robinson soon found out. One day he asked Friday if he would not\n",
      "be glad to be once more in his own land.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes\" said Friday; \"very glad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you eat man's flesh again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never,\" said Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson asked why he did not go back. Friday said he would go if Robinson came too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson, who thought if he could reach other white men, he would finally reach England,\n",
      "began to build a boat in which to leave the island. Together he and Friday went to work to\n",
      "fell a tree, and Friday soon showed that he knew far better than Robinson the kind of tree\n",
      "best suited for boat-making. Robinson showed him how to use tools, and in a little more than\n",
      "a month the boat was finished. After the boat was put into the water, Robinson was astonished\n",
      "at Friday's skill in paddling so large a canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will she do to go over in?\" he asked, and Friday, grinning, said, \"Yes, even if big wind blow.\"\n",
      "But Robinson did not mean to depend on paddling, and fitted the boat with a mast, sails and rudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-six years had passed since Robinson came to the island, and he still went on digging\n",
      "and sowing. One morning he sent Friday down to the beach for a turtle. Back he came in a great\n",
      "hurry, crying out, \"Master! Master! over yonder, one, two, three canoe.\" Loading his guns,\n",
      "Robinson gave them to Friday to carry, while he armed himself with muskets, a cutlass, and\n",
      "a hatchet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was ready he went up the hill with his telescope, and saw that there were in all twenty-one\n",
      "savages, with three prisoners, one of whom was a white man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson knew the savages had landed on the island to kill and eat their prisoners, so he resolved\n",
      "to prevent them if possible. To get at the savages without being seen, they had to go nearly\n",
      "a mile out of their way, and being heavily laden they could not go very fast. Reaching the\n",
      "place, they saw, from behind a clump of bushes, the white man bound hand and foot on the sand.\n",
      "There was no time to lose, and their first shot killed three and wounded five of the savages.\n",
      "Snatching up fresh guns, both fired again, before the savages who were not hurt could get on\n",
      "their feet, for they were so taken by surprise, that the poor wretches hardly knew what was\n",
      "happening. This time only two dropped, but many more were wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Friday kept on firing, Robinson ran to the white prisoner and cut his bonds. The man\n",
      "said he was a Spaniard and began to thank Robinson for what he had done. Robinson handed him\n",
      "the cutlass and a pistol, telling him, if he had any strength left, to go and do what he could\n",
      "against the savages. As soon as the man got the weapons in his hands, he ran with fury at the\n",
      "cannibals and cut two down, and with equal fury attacked the rest. With the Spaniard to help\n",
      "them, Robinson and Friday were soon able to clear the place of these dreadful cannibals, many\n",
      "of whom jumped into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday advised Robinson to take a canoe and go after them lest they return with hundreds of\n",
      "others to avenge the death of their friends. So the two ran to the beach and began to shove\n",
      "off a canoe. But to their surprise, on the bottom of the canoe lay another prisoner, an old\n",
      "man, tied so hard, neck and heels, that even when his bonds were cut he could not move.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did Friday look at him and hear him speak, than he began to dance and shout and laugh,\n",
      "and then kneeling down, rubbed noses with the savage (which is what these folks do instead\n",
      "of kissing each other), and he was so excited that for some time he could not explain what\n",
      "was the matter. As soon as he could speak, he told Robinson that the man whom they had found\n",
      "was his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Friday's father and the Spaniard, who was worn out with fighting, had to be carried up\n",
      "to the castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "No cannibals were ever again known to visit this island.\n",

      "ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH SHIP; ROBINSON SAILS FOR HOME\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this Robinson had a long talk with the Spaniard, who told him how he and his comrades\n",
      "had been wrecked four years since, on that part of the coast where Friday's tribe lived. He\n",
      "said that they were well treated by the natives, but that they were put to very great straits\n",
      "now for want of clothes, that their powder was finished, and that they had lost all hope of\n",
      "ever getting back to their own country. He himself, he said, had been captured in one of the\n",
      "many small wars that are always taking place among the various tribes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck Robinson that it might be possible for him to get these men over to his island, provided\n",
      "that he could be sure of their good faith, and that when they came, they did not take the island\n",
      "from him by treachery. It was a risk, he thought, but then, if he got so many men, it would\n",
      "not be difficult to build a small ship that could carry them all to England.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he asked the Spaniard if he would promise, and if he thought he could get his comrades to\n",
      "take an oath that, if Robinson helped them, they would look on him as their captain, and would\n",
      "swear to obey him in all things. The Spaniard readily promised for himself, and said that he\n",
      "was sure his comrades would keep faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was arranged, therefore, that in about six months, when the next harvest was reaped, and\n",
      "there would be plenty of food for so many extra men, the Spaniard and Friday's father should\n",
      "go over to the mainland in one of the canoes which had been taken from the savages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, all hands set about the curing of very large quantities of raisins, and much other\n",
      "work was done to be in readiness for the coming of these men.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the harvest was reaped, Robinson gave the Spaniard and Friday's father each a musket and\n",
      "a supply of powder and bullets, and loaded the canoe with food, enough to last them and the\n",
      "others about a fortnight, and the two men set off for the mainland in fine weather, and with\n",
      "a fair wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about eight days after this, and when Robinson had begun to look out for their return,\n",
      "that one morning very early, when Robinson was asleep, Friday came running in, shouting, \"Master!\n",
      "Master! They come.\" Up jumped Robinson, and hurrying on his clothes, ran out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking towards the sea, he soon made out a sailing-boat making for the shore, coming from\n",
      "the south end of the island, but still some miles away. This was not the direction from which\n",
      "the Spaniard and his comrades would come, nor were they likely to be in a sailing-boat. So\n",
      "Robinson took his telescope, and went to the top of the hill to see if he could make out who\n",
      "were on board, before they landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had he got on to the hill when he noticed a ship at anchor some distance from the shore.\n",
      "She looked like an English vessel, he thought, and the boat like an English long-boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a wonderful sight to Robinson, but yet he was not easy in his mind. It was not a part\n",
      "of the world where an English ship was likely to come, because in those days they were nearly\n",
      "all Spanish vessels that traded in these seas, and the English and Spaniards were bitter enemies.\n",
      "What could an English ship be doing here? There had been no storm to drive her out of her course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson feared that if she was English there must be something wrong about her. Perhaps, he\n",
      "thought, she was a pirate. So he was careful not to show himself or Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, as he watched, he saw the men in the boat run her ashore and draw her up on the\n",
      "beach, about half a mile from his castle. When they had landed, he could easily see through\n",
      "his glass that they were Englishmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were eleven men, but three of them had their hands tied behind their backs, and were\n",
      "evidently prisoners. When the first four or five men had jumped ashore, they brought out these\n",
      "three, all the while ill-treating them, and behaving as if they meant to kill their prisoners.\n",
      "Friday was sure that they meant to eat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, without further harming the three men, the others scattered about among the trees near\n",
      "the shore, leaving the three sitting on the ground very sad-looking, but with their hands now\n",
      "untied.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time the boat was run aground, it was just high-water, and the two sailors who had been\n",
      "left in charge of her, and who had evidently been drinking too much rum, went to sleep, and\n",
      "never noticed that the tide was going out. When they woke, the boat was high and dry, and with\n",
      "all the strength of the whole crew they could not move her, because the sand at that part of\n",
      "the beach was very soft. This did not seem to trouble any of them very much, for Robinson heard\n",
      "one of the sailors shout, \"Let her alone, Jack, can't ye? She'll float next tide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All forenoon Robinson watched, and when the hottest time of the day had come, he noticed the\n",
      "sailors throw themselves down under the trees, and go to sleep, some distance away from the\n",
      "three prisoners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson and Friday, taking their muskets and pistols, stole down cautiously behind the\n",
      "three men, to try to speak to them without the others knowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson had put on his goatskin coat and the great hairy hat that he had made for himself;\n",
      "and with his cutlass and pistols in his belt, and a gun over each shoulder, he looked very fierce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men did not see him till he spoke, and they were so startled by his wild look, and by the\n",
      "sight of two men armed to the teeth, that they nearly ran away. But Robinson told them not\n",
      "to be alarmed; he was an Englishman, and a friend, and would help them if they would show him\n",
      "how it could be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they explained to him what had happened. One of the three was Captain of the ship that\n",
      "lay at anchor off the island. Of the others, one was mate of the ship, and the third man was\n",
      "a passenger. The crew had mutinied, the Captain told Robinson, and had put him and the other\n",
      "two in irons, and the ringleaders in the mutiny had proposed to kill them. Now they meant to\n",
      "leave them on the island to perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Captain was so astonished at finding anybody there who proposed to help him, that he said\n",
      "in his wonder: \"Am I talking to a man, or to an angel from heaven?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the Lord had sent an angel, sir,\" said Robinson, \"he would probably have come better clothed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he asked if the boat's crew had any firearms, and was told that they had only two muskets,\n",
      "one of which was left in the boat. \"The rest should be easy, then,\" Robinson said; \"we can\n",
      "either kill them all, or take them prisoners, as we please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Captain was unwilling to see the men killed, for he said if two of the worst of them were\n",
      "got rid of, he believed the rest would return to their duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson made a bargain that if he saved the Captain from the mutineers, and recovered the\n",
      "ship, he and Friday were to be taken home to England in her, free of cost; and to this the\n",
      "Captain and the others agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Robinson gave each of them a musket, with powder and ball, after which the Captain and\n",
      "the mate and the passenger marched towards the spot where the mutinous sailors lay asleep.\n",
      "One of the men heard them advance, and turning round, saw them, and cried out to his companions.\n",
      "But it was too late, the mate and the passenger fired, and one of the ringleaders fell dead.\n",
      "A second man also fell, but jumped up immediately and called to the others to help him. But\n",
      "the Captain knocked him down with the butt of his musket, and the rest of the men, seeing Robinson\n",
      "and Friday coming, and knowing they had no chance against five armed men, begged for mercy.\n",
      "Three others who had been straying about among the trees came back on hearing the shots, and\n",
      "were also taken, and thus the whole crew of the boat was captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Captain and Robinson now began to think how they might recover the ship. There were on\n",
      "board, the Captain said, several men on whom he thought he could depend, and who had been forced\n",
      "by the others into the mutiny against their wills. But it would be no easy thing to retake\n",
      "the ship, for there were still twenty-six men on board, and as they were guilty of mutiny,\n",
      "all of them, if taken back to England, would most likely be hanged. Thus they were certain\n",
      "to make a fight for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing that Robinson and the others now did was to take everything out of the boat--oars,\n",
      "and mast, and sail, and rudder; then they knocked a hole in her bottom, so that she could not\n",
      "float. While they were doing this, and drawing her still further up on the beach, they heard\n",
      "first one gun and then another fired by the ship as signals to the boat to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she of course did not move, Robinson saw through his glass another boat with ten men on\n",
      "board, armed with muskets, leave the ship, coming to bring the others back.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was serious enough, for now Robinson and his party had to make plans whereby they might\n",
      "capture also this fresh boat's crew. Accordingly, they tied the hands of all the men they had\n",
      "first taken, and sent the worst of them to the cave under the charge of Friday and of one of\n",
      "the men that the Captain said was to be trusted, with orders to shoot any who tried to give\n",
      "an alarm or to escape. Then Robinson took his party and the rest of the prisoners into the\n",
      "castle, where, from the rock, they watched for the landing of the second boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Captain and mate were very nervous, and despaired of taking this fresh body of men, but\n",
      "Robinson was quite confident of success, and put heart into them by his cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the prisoners in his castle, there were two whom the Captain believed to be honest men,\n",
      "and on their promising solemnly to keep faith, and to fight for him, Robinson released them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew of the second boat, when they landed, were terribly surprised to find the first boat\n",
      "empty and stove in, and they were seen anxiously consulting what to do. Then they hallooed\n",
      "and fired volleys. Getting no reply, they were evidently alarmed, for they all jumped into\n",
      "their boat and began to pull off to the ship. In a few minutes, however, they seemed to change\n",
      "their minds, for again they landed, this time leaving three men in charge of the boat, and\n",
      "keeping her in the water. The other seven came ashore, and started in a body across the island\n",
      "to look for their lost comrades. But they did not care to go far, and soon stopped, again firing\n",
      "volleys and hallooing. Getting again no reply, they began to march back to the sea. Whereupon\n",
      "Robinson ordered Friday and the mate to go over the creek to the west and halloo loudly, and\n",
      "wait till the sailors answered. Then Friday and the mate were to go further away and again\n",
      "halloo, thus gradually getting the men to follow them away from shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan succeeded very well, for when the sailors, thinking they heard their missing friends\n",
      "hail, ran to find them, their way was stopped by the creek, over which they had to get the\n",
      "boat to carry them. They took with them, then, one of the three men whom they had left in the\n",
      "boat, and ordered the others to moor the boat to a tree, and remain there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just what Robinson wanted. And, moreover, one of the men played still further into\n",
      "his hands, for he left the boat and lay down under a tree to sleep. On him the Captain rushed,\n",
      "and knocked him down as he tried to rise to his feet, whereupon the sailor left in the boat\n",
      "yielded, and more readily that he had joined the mutineers very unwillingly, and was now glad\n",
      "of the chance to rejoin his Captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime Friday and the mate, by hallooing and answering, drew the rest of the boat's crew\n",
      "from hill to hill through the woods, till at last they had got them so far astray that it was\n",
      "not possible for them to find their way back before dark. When they did get back to where the\n",
      "boat had been left, and found the men whom they had left in her gone, they were in a terrible\n",
      "fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not difficult for Robinson and his men to surround them, and it chanced that the boatswain\n",
      "of the ship, who was the greatest villain of the lot, and the chief cause of all the trouble,\n",
      "walked in the darkness close to the Captain, who jumped up and shot him dead. The others then\n",
      "surrendered, believing what they were told, that they were surrounded by fifty armed men. All\n",
      "begged hard for their lives, and a few whom the Captain said he could trust were set at liberty\n",
      "on promising to help retake the ship. The others were bound and put in the cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson and Friday remained on shore to look after the prisoners, while the Captain and the\n",
      "mate and the passenger, with those of the crew who were trustworthy, having patched up the\n",
      "damaged boat, pulled off in her and in the other to the ship, which they reached about midnight.\n",
      "When they were a short distance off, the Captain made one of the crew hail the ship and say\n",
      "that they had brought off the boat and the men they had gone in search of. Then both boats\n",
      "ran alongside at once, one on each side of the vessel, and before the mutineers knew what was\n",
      "happening they were overpowered, one or two of them being killed. Only one of the Captain's\n",
      "party was hurt, the mate, whose arm was broken by a musket-ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson's stay in the island had now come to an end, after more than twenty-eight years, for\n",
      "in a few days he and Friday sailed for England in the ship. Some of the mutineers were left\n",
      "on the island, and were afterwards joined by the Spaniard and his comrades, for whom Robinson\n",
      "left a letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinson did not forget, when he left, to take with him the money and gold bars he had got\n",
      "from the wreck of the Spanish ship, and he took also, as a memento, the goatskin coat and the\n",
      "great hairy hat. But the Captain was able before the ship sailed to give him proper clothing,\n",
      "the wearing of which at first put him to dreadful discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voyage was a long one, but they sighted the English coast at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was thirty-five years since Robinson had set foot in England. And that morning, when at\n",
      "last, after the weary years of exile, he again saw his native land, he laid his head down on\n",
      "his arms and cried like a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, may be, you too some day may know the joy of coming home, out of the land of bondage.\n",
      "In the same country lived a beautiful lady called Dorigen. And the knight loved the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years Arviragus did not know whether she loved him or not. She was a great lady and very\n",
      "fair, and he was afraid to ask her. But she knew that he loved her, for when he rode past her\n",
      "window on his way to the wars, she could see her colors streaming from his helmet. At first\n",
      "she did not think much of this, for many knights fought for love of her; but as she heard of\n",
      "new and greater deeds that this noble knight did year by year, she began to care for him a\n",
      "great deal. When she thought of his goodness and of the honor in which he held her, she knew\n",
      "that there was no one else that she could love as she loved Arviragus. And when Arviragus knew\n",
      "that she loved him and was willing to be his wife, his heart was full of joy. So greatly did\n",
      "he wish to make Dorigen happy with him, that he said to her that he would obey her and do what\n",
      "she wished as gladly all his life as he had done while he was trying to win her love. To this\n",
      "she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, since in thy great gentleness thou givest me so high a place, I pray to God that there\n",
      "may never be strife between us two by any fault of mine. Sir, I will be thy true and humble\n",
      "wife until I die!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Arviragus took his bride home with him to his castle by the sea. He honored Dorigen as\n",
      "much as he had done before his marriage, and tried to fulfil her wishes in everything. Dorigen\n",
      "was just as eager to please Arviragus as he was to please her, and they were happy together\n",
      "in all their work and play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arviragus stayed quietly at home for a year, but after that he grew restless. He felt that\n",
      "no true knight had a right to live on quietly at home, with nothing to do except to order his\n",
      "castle and to hunt. So he sailed away to England that he might win honor and renown in the\n",
      "wars there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen stood by the castle and watched his sails disappear in the north. Poor Dorigen! her\n",
      "husband was gone, and she did not know if he would ever come back to her. For weeks she wept\n",
      "and mourned. At night she could not rest, and by day she would not eat. All the things that\n",
      "she had cared most to do were now dull and worthless to her because Arviragus was away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her friends saw her sorrow, and tried to comfort her in every way they could. When they found\n",
      "she would not be comforted, they spoke harshly to her, and told her that it was very wrong\n",
      "of her to kill herself with sorrow, when Arviragus hoped to come home again strong and famous.\n",
      "Then they began to comfort her again, and to try to make her forget her sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long time Dorigen's sorrow began to grow quieter. She could not have lived if she had\n",
      "always felt her grief as deeply as she did at first. Indeed, as it was, this sorrow would have\n",
      "broken her heart, if letters had not come from Arviragus. They brought her tidings of his doings,\n",
      "and of the glory he had won. But what comforted her most was that they told her that he would\n",
      "soon return.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dorigen's friends saw that she was less hopeless, they begged her to come and roam with\n",
      "them to drive away the last of her dark fears. This she did. Often she walked with them by\n",
      "the edge of the cliffs on which her castle stood. But there she saw the white ships and the\n",
      "brown barges sailing, one north, another south, to the havens for which they were bound. Then\n",
      "she would turn away from her friends and say to herself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas! of all the ships I see, is there never one that will bring my lord home? Then should\n",
      "I need no comfort. My heart would be cured of this bitter smart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At times as she sat and thought, she leaned down and looked over the brink of the cliffs. But,\n",
      "when she saw the grisly, black rocks, her very heart trembled within her. Then she would sink\n",
      "down on the grass and wail:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O God, men say Thou hast made nothing in vain, but, Lord, why hast Thou made these black,\n",
      "grisly rocks? No man nor beast is helped by them in all the world. Rocks have destroyed a hundred\n",
      "thousand men, and which of all Thy works is so fair as man? No doubt wise men will say, 'All\n",
      "is for the best.' But, oh Thou God, who makest the winds to blow, keep Thou my lord! And--would\n",
      "to God that these black rocks were sunk in the deep for his sake! They slay my heart with fear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen's friends saw that the sea brought back her sorrow. They led her then by rivers and\n",
      "springs, and took her to every lovely place they knew, from which there was no glimpse of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the valley, to landward of the castle, lay many beautiful gardens. One day in May, when\n",
      "the soft showers of spring had painted in brightest colors the leaves and flowers, they spent\n",
      "the whole day in the fairest of these gardens. They had games there, and they dined under a\n",
      "spreading tree. The breath of the fresh green leaves and the sweet scent of the flowers blew\n",
      "round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner they began to dance and sing--every one except Dorigen. She had no heart to sing,\n",
      "and she would not dance because, of all who joined in the dance, not one was Arviragus. But,\n",
      "though she would not dance, she watched her friends and sometimes forgot her sorrow for a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the dancers there was a young squire named Aurelius. He was much beloved because he was\n",
      "young, and strong, and handsome. Men thought him wise and good, but he was not always wise\n",
      "and good.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the dancing was over, Aurelius came up to Dorigen and asked her to give him a beautiful\n",
      "jewel that she wore on her breast. He said to her, \"Madam, of what use is thy jewel to thee\n",
      "when thou wearest it on thy bosom? Give it to me, and I will share with thee the price of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen turned and gazed at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this what thou dost wish? I knew not what thou didst mean when thou didst look at me, but\n",
      "now I know. Listen, this is all I have to say to thee. I shall never part with my jewel, not\n",
      "though I were in rags and without food.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she remembered how Arviragus had loved to see her wear her jewel, as she always did, on\n",
      "a chain of gold that he had given to her on her wedding day. She thought of the sea that separated\n",
      "him from her, and of the cruel black rocks, and said in play:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aurelius, I will freely give thee my jewel when thou dost remove every rock on the shore from\n",
      "end to end of Brittany.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her anger at the selfishness of Aurelius rose again, and she bade him begone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" he said, \"it is impossible to move the rocks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that word he turned away, and went home to his own house. There his brother Austin found\n",
      "him in a trance, for Aurelius wished Dorigen's jewel more than he wished anything else on earth,\n",
      "and the thought that he could not get it made him so sad that he became dazed. Austin carried\n",
      "him to bed, and tried to soothe him in his grief and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jewel that Aurelius wished to get from Dorigen was no common one. It had been given to\n",
      "her at her birth. It was clear as crystal, but far more rare, and it shone in the daylight\n",
      "like the sun. When Dorigen was a little child her mother told her of this wonderful stone.\n",
      "She told her that it would bring her joy and peace and the love of all who were good and true,\n",
      "if she kept it bright and pure; but that, if she ever gave it away, she would lose her youth\n",
      "and her beauty, and would be hidden away from all her friends and left alone in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen shuddered at the thought of parting with her jewel. She did not know how her mother's\n",
      "words could come to pass, if she did give it away, nor by what magic power she could be so\n",
      "lost that no one who loved her could find her again. But she was sure that what her mother\n",
      "had said must be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was why Dorigen was so angry with Aurelius. She knew that he must have heard what\n",
      "sorrow she would suffer if she gave him her jewel, for all the court knew the story of the\n",
      "wonderful stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after this, Arviragus came home. He had won more honor than before, and was now the\n",
      "very flower of chivalry. I cannot tell you how great the joy was, with which he greeted Dorigen,\n",
      "nor how soon she forgot her fears of the sea and the grisly rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two years, while they lived a joyful life together, Aurelius lay in bed unable to rise,\n",
      "with no one to take care of him except his brother Austin. This brother mourned over Aurelius\n",
      "in secret and wept at his unhappy fate, till one day he remembered a book of magic that he\n",
      "had seen when he was a student in Orleans. In that book he had read of the strange ways in\n",
      "which Magicians can make things seem what they are not. His heart leapt up. He said to himself,\n",
      "\"My brother shall be cured. I am sure I have heard of stranger things than that the rocks should\n",
      "seem to vanish. Once I heard of a Magician who made every one believe that a great brown barge\n",
      "was rowing up and down a sheet of water inside the hall of a castle! If he could do that, then\n",
      "surely we shall be able to find a Magician who will make those black rocks seem to vanish.\n",
      "Then Dorigen will have to keep her promise and give Aurelius her wonderful jewel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Austin then ran to his brother's room and told him about the book of magic at Orleans. No sooner\n",
      "had Aurelius heard him than he leapt out of bed. In less time than one would think possible\n",
      "he was ready to start on the long ride to Orleans.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came near the city they met a Magician. They knew him to be a Magician because of\n",
      "the strange look in his eyes, and because of his curious dress. When they rode up to him he\n",
      "bowed before them and wished them \"Good day.\" Then he began to tell them why they had come\n",
      "to Orleans. Aurelius wondered how it was that this stranger knew so much about him and his\n",
      "errand. He thought he must be a very wise man indeed, and leaping from his horse in surprise\n",
      "and joy, he went home with the Magician to his house. His brother went too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was the finest that Aurelius had ever seen. When he entered the study he looked in\n",
      "wonder at the rows of books that lined the walls, and at the quaint pictures and the strange\n",
      "old armor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one corner a curious light burned. It was not like the light of a lamp or of a candle, but\n",
      "cold and blue. Above it hung a map of the stars, and other strange drawings. Below the light\n",
      "stood a table, and on it lay a great book which was chained to the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Austin saw Aurelius look at this book. He whispered to him, \"It is the same book from which\n",
      "I read long ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This corner with its blue light made Aurelius frightened. A shudder passed over him when he\n",
      "saw the Magician cross over into the circle of the light and wave his wand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment Aurelius forgot all about the Magician and his own fear, for he and his brother\n",
      "saw before them the edge of a forest with a park stretching from the trees far, far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun shone, and the branches waved a little in the breeze. In the park the brothers saw\n",
      "herds of deer. Beautiful animals they were, with the highest antlers deer ever had. At first\n",
      "the deer fed in peace and safety. Then archers, clad in green, came to the edge of the forest.\n",
      "They glided out and in among the trees to see where they could best take aim with their arrows.\n",
      "When the archers had let their arrows fly, hounds broke out from behind them, and soon there\n",
      "was not one living deer of all the herd left in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment a calm river flowed where the park had been. In the shallow water at the river's\n",
      "edge tall herons stood. They watched for the little fishes that swam in the river. Again, into\n",
      "this quiet place a hunter came. He had no arrows. He had no dogs. But on his wrist he had an\n",
      "iron bracelet to which one end of a chain was fastened. The other end of the chain was round\n",
      "a hawk's foot, and the hawk sat on his master's wrist. When the hunter came near the river\n",
      "he loosed the chain from the bird's foot. The hawk flew over the river and swooped down among\n",
      "the herons. In a moment they had all vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aurelius had scarcely time to sigh, when the river itself was gone, and a plain lay where it\n",
      "had been. There he saw the knights of King Arthur's Table jousting. Beautiful ladies sat and\n",
      "watched the struggle, and one more fair than all held the prizes the knights might win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the figures of the knights began to grow dim and uncertain. The plain changed into a great\n",
      "hall where knights and ladies danced. Everything was bright and sparkling. Mirrors lined the\n",
      "walls, and their cut edges flashed back the light that fell on them. As Aurelius watched the\n",
      "dance, he started. There, before him, more beautiful than ever, was Dorigen. His heart gave\n",
      "a great leap, for, as he watched her, he saw that she no longer wore her jewel. In his delight\n",
      "he swayed to the music of the dance. Clap! clap! went the Magician's hands, and all was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great room that had seemed so splendid to Aurelius when he entered it, looked cold and\n",
      "plain now when he returned to it from fairyland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Magician called his servant and asked for supper. Then he led the brothers away and feasted\n",
      "them royally.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper the three men began to talk about what the Magician should get from Aurelius if\n",
      "he made the rocks vanish. The Magician said, \"I cannot take less than a thousand pounds, and\n",
      "I am not sure if I can do it for that!\" Aurelius was too delighted to bargain about what the\n",
      "cost would be. He said gladly: \"What is a thousand pounds? I would give thee the whole round\n",
      "world, if I were lord of it. The bargain is made. Thou shalt be paid in full. But do not delay.\n",
      "Let us start to-morrow morning without fail.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou mayest count on me to-morrow,\" said the Magician.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went to bed, and Aurelius slept soundly and well; because of the hope he had that the\n",
      "Magician would make the rocks vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning they rose early. It was Christmas time, and the air was cold and frosty as they\n",
      "rode away. The very sunlight was pale, and the trees were bare. When they reached home the\n",
      "neighbors gathered round and wished them a Merry Christmas. \"Noel, Noel,\" they said, but they\n",
      "would not have done so had they known what sorrow the riders brought to their beautiful lady\n",
      "Dorigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many days the Magician worked with his maps and figures. Aurelius waited impatiently. There\n",
      "was nothing for him to do except to make the Magician as comfortable as he could, and to show\n",
      "him as much kindness as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning Aurelius looked from his window towards the sea. He saw the Magician standing on\n",
      "the shore. As Aurelius gazed out to sea, the rocks vanished from north to south. His heart\n",
      "stood still. Then he rushed out and away to the edge of the cliffs for fear some rocks might\n",
      "still lie close to the land. But no, there was not one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to meet the Magician and fell at his feet with the words, \"Thanks to thee, my lord,\n",
      "thanks to thee, my cares are gone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had thanked the Wise Man, he hurried away to meet Dorigen. When he saw her he trembled.\n",
      "She was so pure and beautiful. His heart sank. Then he looked out to sea and saw the smooth\n",
      "surface of the water, and he grew selfish again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen came quietly on. She had not noticed that the rocks had vanished, for Arviragus was\n",
      "safe on land, and she did not fear the sea any more. She had almost forgotten Aurelius and\n",
      "his selfish, greedy words. It was more than two years since she had seen him, and she had not\n",
      "heard of him since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "She started back when he greeted her. Before she had time to speak he said, \"My lady, give\n",
      "me thy jewel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw Dorigen's face grow cold and angry, and said, \"Think well lest thou break thy word,\n",
      "for, madam, thou knowest well what thou didst say. In yonder garden in the month of May thou\n",
      "didst promise to give me thy jewel when I should move the rocks. I speak to save thine honor.\n",
      "I have done as thou didst command me. Go thou and see if thou wilt, but well I know the rocks\n",
      "are vanished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He left her then. She stood still, white and sick. She had never dreamt that such a trap as\n",
      "this could close on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas,\" she said, \"that such a thing could happen! I never thought a thing so strange and unheard-of\n",
      "could come to pass!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Home she went in sadness and dismay. She was so weak with fear that she could scarcely walk.\n",
      "She had to suffer her sorrow alone for three days, for Arviragus was away, and she would tell\n",
      "no one but him. Her ladies saw her distress, but they could not comfort her. To herself she\n",
      "moaned, \"Alas, O Fortune, I lay the blame on thee; thou hast so bound me in thy chain, that\n",
      "I see no help nor escape save only in death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arviragus came home on the third day after the rocks had vanished. He came at night, so he\n",
      "noticed nothing strange about the shore. Though every one was talking of the curious thing\n",
      "that had happened, no one liked to tell him. They knew he would not like to hear of it. He\n",
      "would think his country was bewitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arviragus looked for Dorigen in the hall. When he could not see her there, he hurried to her\n",
      "room, to make sure that she was safe and well. As he sprang up the broad staircase, the sheath\n",
      "of his sword and the spurs at his heels clanked harshly on the stone steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen heard him, but, instead of going to meet him, she buried her head deeper in her cushions\n",
      "and wept. Arviragus crossed the room to where she sat, and knelt before her. He drew her hands\n",
      "from her eyes and said, \"Dorigen, what is it? Why dost thou weep like this, my beloved?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a little time Dorigen's tears only fell the faster, then she said brokenly: \"Alas, that\n",
      "ever I was born! I have said it! Arviragus! I have promised!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What hast thou promised, my wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dorigen told Arviragus all that had happened; told him that she had promised to give her\n",
      "jewel to Aurelius when he would take all the rocks away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arviragus leapt up and went to the window. The moon had burst through a cloud, and everything\n",
      "was bright and clear. He looked away north, as Dorigen had so often looked to watch for his\n",
      "coming. In the moonlight Arviragus saw the sea lie smooth and cold. His eyes swept the skyline.\n",
      "It seemed as as if all the rocks had sunk into his heart, it was so heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned towards Dorigen, and saw how great was her sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said very gently: \"Is there aught else than this, that thou shouldst weep, Dorigen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, nay, this is indeed too much already,\" she sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear wife,\" he said, \"something as wonderful as the sinking of the rocks may happen to save\n",
      "us yet. God grant it! But whether or not, thou must keep thy troth. I had rather that my great\n",
      "love for thee caused me to die, than that thou shouldest break thy promise. Truth is the highest\n",
      "thing that man may keep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then his courage broke down, and he began to sob and weep along with Dorigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning he was strong and brave again. He said to Dorigen, \"I will bear up under this\n",
      "great sorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He bade her farewell, and she set out with only a maid and a squire to follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arviragus could not bear to see Dorigen as she went down from the castle, so he hid himself\n",
      "in an inner room. But some one saw her go out. It was Aurelius. For three days he had watched\n",
      "the castle gate to see what she did, and where she went. He came forward and said, \"Whither\n",
      "goest thou?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen was almost mad with misery, but she said bravely, \"To thee, to keep my troth, and give\n",
      "my jewel to thee, as my husband bids me. Alas! alas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aurelius was full of wonder when he heard this. He began to be sorry for Dorigen, and for Arviragus\n",
      "the worthy knight, who would rather lose his wife than have her break her word. He could be\n",
      "cruel no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" he said, \"say to thy lord Arviragus that since I see his great honor and thy sad distress,\n",
      "I had rather bear my own sorrow than drive thee away from him and all thy friends. I give thee\n",
      "back thy promise. I shall never trouble thee more. Farewell, farewell! thou truest woman and\n",
      "best that I have ever seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down on her knees, on the roadway, fell Dorigen to thank Aurelius. Her blessing followed him\n",
      "as he turned and left her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how can I tell of Dorigen's return? She seemed to be treading on air. When she reached\n",
      "the room where her husband sat with his head sunk on his arms, she paused. She had not known\n",
      "the greatness of his love till then. He looked old and forlorn after the night of sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke, and he raised his eyes to gaze on her, as if she had been a lady in a dream. But\n",
      "when she told him all, when he knew that she was there herself, and for always, he could not\n",
      "speak for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aurelius wished he had never been born when he thought of the thousand pounds of pure gold\n",
      "that he owed to the Magician.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said to himself, \"What shall I do? I am undone! I must sell my house and be a beggar. I\n",
      "will not stay here and make my friends ashamed of me, unless I can get the Magician to give\n",
      "me time. I will ask him to let me pay him part of my debt year by year till all is paid. If\n",
      "he will, my gratitude will know no bounds, and I will pay him every penny I owe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a sore heart he went to his coffer and took out five hundred pounds of gold. These he\n",
      "took to the Wise Man, and begged him to grant him time to pay the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master,\" said he, \"I can say truly, I never yet failed to keep a promise. My debt shall be\n",
      "paid to thee, even if I go begging in rags. But if thou wilt be so gracious as to allow me\n",
      "two years, or three, in which to pay the, rest, I will rejoice. If not, I must sell my house;\n",
      "there is no other way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Magician heard this he said, \"Have not I kept my promise to thee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, certainly, well and truly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hast thou not thy jewel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Aurelius, and sighed deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, if thou mayest, what is the cause of this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arviragus in his honor had rather die in sorrow and distress than that his wife should break\n",
      "her word. Dorigen would rather die than lose her husband and wander alone on the earth. She\n",
      "did not mean to give me her promise. She thought the rocks would never move. I pitied them\n",
      "so much that I gave her back her promise as freely as she brought her jewel to me. That is\n",
      "the whole story!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Magician answered, \"Dear brother, you have each behaved nobly. Thou art a squire, he is\n",
      "a knight, but by God's grace I can do a noble deed as well as another. Sir, thou art free from\n",
      "thy debt to me, as free as if thou hadst this moment crept out of the ground, and hadst never\n",
      "known me till now. For, sir, I will not take a penny from thee for all my skill, nor for all\n",
      "my work. It is enough! Farewell! Good day to thee!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon the Magician bowed once and again, mounted his horse, and rode away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen and Arviragus were walking on the cliffs as the Magician parted from Aurelius. They\n",
      "noticed the two men, and when the horseman rode away they saw a strange white mist rise from\n",
      "the sea and follow the rider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorigen caught her husband's arm, for there, there, out at sea, and close by the cliffs, were\n",
      "the rocks, grisly and black and fearsome as before. The sunlight fell on her jewel, and it\n",
      "shone more brightly than of old, nor did its light ever grow dim in all the happy years that\n",
      "followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "EMELIA\n",
      "\n",
      "Emelia the Radiant lived in a great castle in Athens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolyta, Emelia's sister, had once been queen of the Warrior Women, and had led her armies\n",
      "to battle. But Emelia had never fought in these battles. When she was still a child, Duke Theseus\n",
      "of Athens had fought with Hippolyta and conquered her. Instead of sending his royal captive\n",
      "to prison, Theseus married her, and took her home to Athens with him. When he took her there,\n",
      "he took Emelia with her. He was very kind to them both, and the castle in Athens was a happy\n",
      "home for Hippolyta and her little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Emelia grew up she became most beautiful. She was more graceful than a lily on its stem,\n",
      "and the flush on her cheeks was more delicate than the hue of the rose-petals in the old Greek\n",
      "castle garden. Her golden hair fell in heavy masses round her face, and lay in a great plait\n",
      "down her back. It caught all the light that fell on it, and sent it out again to make glad\n",
      "the hearts of those who looked on her. So men called her Emelia the Radiant, and all who met\n",
      "her smiled for joy at the sight of so beautiful a maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "One May morning Emelia went into the castle garden to bathe her face in the early dew. Everything\n",
      "was dim and gray in the twilight. She looked up at the great dungeon tower which overshadowed\n",
      "the garden, and thought of the two young princes who were prisoners there. Duke Theseus had\n",
      "brought them from Thebes. He was very proud of them, and would not give them up, although the\n",
      "people of their land offered to give him gold and jewels for their ransom. The princes were\n",
      "cousins, and were the last of the royal line of Thebes. In the stillness Emelia murmured their\n",
      "names to herself, \"Palamon and Arcite, Palamon and Arcite. How miserable they must be in their\n",
      "narrow cell!\" she thought. Then she sighed that life should be so sad for them while it was\n",
      "so bright for her!\n",
      "\n",
      "As she roamed up and down and gathered roses white and red to make a garland for her hair,\n",
      "the sun broke through the mist and shone into the garden. Once more she raised her eyes to\n",
      "the tower. This time she did not look at it, but at the sunlit clouds beyond. The light from\n",
      "the east fell on her. Her hair shone like gold, and her face was radiant with happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon at that moment came to the narrow iron-barred window through which alone he and his\n",
      "cousin could see the sky and the fields and the city. He saw the morning light fall on the\n",
      "fair buildings of Athens, and on the plains and hills beyond. Then a glad song which burst\n",
      "from Emelia's happy heart floated up to him. He looked down. Before him stood the maiden bathed\n",
      "in sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to him the very Spirit of Beauty. He thought of all the joy and life and freedom\n",
      "that he could never have. He started back from the window and cried aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "His cousin Arcite sprang from his couch and said, \"My cousin, what aileth thee? I pray thee\n",
      "that thou bear our imprisonment in patience. Sad it is in truth, but we must abide it. We can\n",
      "do nought else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Palamon said: \"Thou art mistaken. Prison walls drew not that cry from me. An arrow hath\n",
      "entered my heart through mine eye, and I am wounded. What life can give is bound up for me\n",
      "in the fairness of a maiden who roams in yonder garden. Be she Spirit or woman I know not!\n",
      "But this I know, was never woman nor Spirit half so fair before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit of Beauty,\" he cried, \"if thou choosest to take the form of a radiant woman here before\n",
      "me in this garden, pity my wretchedness! Save us from this prison, and if that may not be,\n",
      "have pity on our country and help our fallen friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arcite pressed forward and leant over Palamon's shoulder. The window was only a narrow slit,\n",
      "and the wall through which it was cut was thick, so it was not easy for Arcite to see into\n",
      "the garden. At last he caught a glimpse of Emelia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, how lovely she is!\" he said. \"I shall die of my wish to serve her. Most beautiful of maidens\n",
      "she is, truly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Palamon heard this, he turned on Arcite, looked coldly at him and asked, \"Sayest thou\n",
      "so in earnest or in jest?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, truly in earnest, my cousin; I have little will to jest!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon looked fiercely at him and said, \"Little honor to thee then! Hast thou forgotten thine\n",
      "oath of truest brotherhood to me, and mine to thee? Hast thou forgotten thy promise to help\n",
      "me in all I do? How, then, canst thou dream of claiming to love my lady? This thou shalt not\n",
      "do, false Arcite! I loved her first, and told thee, and thou must help me to win her if ever\n",
      "we escape. Thine honor demands this of thee. Otherwise thou art no true knight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Arcite drew himself up scornfully and said, \"Rather it is thou that art false! A moment\n",
      "ago thou didst not know whether she were maiden or Spirit! I loved her first for what she is,\n",
      "and told thee as my brother! But even if thou hadst loved her first, could I, because of that,\n",
      "refuse to love the fairest of maidens? Besides, why should we strive? Thou knowest too well\n",
      "that thou shalt never win her smile, nor yet shall I! These prison walls so thick and black\n",
      "leave no hope for us. We fight as did the fabled dogs for the bone. They fought all day, yet\n",
      "neither won. There came a kite while they raged, and carried off the bone. Love thou the maid\n",
      "if thou wilt. I shall love her till I die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prison had been narrow and bare and cold before, but now it seemed ten times more dismal.\n",
      "The world from which it shut them in was so much more sweet because of the maiden who dwelt\n",
      "there, and the friendship for each other which had cheered them through many evil days was broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Emelia the Radiant sang her gay songs and stepped lightly among the flowers, with never\n",
      "another thought of the weary eyes that watched her.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day the greatest friend that Duke Theseus of Athens had, came to see him. This friend had\n",
      "known Arcite in Thebes, and had loved the handsome boy. He begged Theseus to forgive him, and\n",
      "to let him go free. Theseus was glad to find something he could do to please his dear friend,\n",
      "so one morning he took him with him to the prison where Palamon and Arcite were. The attendants\n",
      "could scarcely follow, for the royal robes filled all the dingy little space! A streak of light\n",
      "from the window fell on the Duke's mantle and his jewels. They looked strangely bright in that\n",
      "dark room beside the faded clothes of the two young prisoners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arcite and the friend of Theseus greeted each other joyously, and the heart of Arcite beat\n",
      "wildly with hope, but when he heard the words of Theseus the Duke it sank like lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arcite,\" said he, \"by the desire of my friend, I grant to thee thy freedom. I grant it on\n",
      "one condition only. Thou must wander away far beyond my kingdom. If ever thou art seen for\n",
      "one moment on any furthest corner of my land, that moment shall be thy last. By the sword thou\n",
      "shalt die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Homeward to Thebes sped Arcite with a sad heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Woe is me for the day that I was born!\" he moaned; \"woe is me that ever I knew the friend\n",
      "of Theseus! Had he not known me, I might even now be gazing on the maiden I serve, from the\n",
      "window in the Duke's tower. Ah, Palamon, thou art the victor now! Day by day thou gazest on\n",
      "her, and kind fortune may grant to thee thy freedom and her favor while I am banished for ever!\n",
      "Ah, why do we complain against our fortune? We know that we seek happiness, but know not the\n",
      "road thither! Think how I dreamt and longed for freedom, and thought that if I were only out\n",
      "of prison my joy would be perfect. Behold, my freedom is my banishment, and my hope my undoing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Palamon, when he saw that Arcite was gone, he made the great tower walls re-echo with\n",
      "his howls of misery. The very fetters on his ankles were wet with his salt tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas,\" he groaned, \"Arcite, my cousin, thou hast borne off the prize in this strife of ours!\n",
      "Thou walkest now at liberty in Thebes. Little thou thinkest of me and of my sorrow! Strong\n",
      "thou art, and wise. Doubtless thou art even now gathering together the people of Thebes to\n",
      "invade this land and win the sister of the Duke for thy wife, while I die here in this prison\n",
      "like a caged lion. The prison walls heed my weeping and my wailing not at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not even rejoice in the sight of Emelia when she walked in the garden, so fearful\n",
      "was he lest Arcite should win her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Arcite passed his days in Thebes in grief. He wandered about alone, and wailed and\n",
      "made moan to himself. He cared not to eat, and sleep forsook him. His spirits were so feeble\n",
      "that the sound of music brought fresh tears to his eyes. He grew gaunt and thin, and his voice\n",
      "was hollow with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, when he was nearly dazed with sorrow, he dreamt one night that a beautiful winged\n",
      "boy with golden curls stood before him. \"Go thou to Athens,\" said the boy; \"the end of all\n",
      "thy sorrow awaits thee there!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arcite started up wide awake and said, \"I will to Athens, to my lady. It were good even to\n",
      "die in her presence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught up a mirror. He had not cared to look in one for many months, but now that he meant\n",
      "to return to his lady, he wished to see if he looked strong and young as ever. At first he\n",
      "was shocked to see how great a change had passed over his face. Then he thought, \"If I do not\n",
      "say who I am, I may live unknown in Athens for years. Then I shall see my lady day by day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly he called to him a squire, and told him all his will, and bound him to keep his name\n",
      "a secret and to answer no questions about himself or his master. Then Arcite sent his squire\n",
      "to find clothes such as the laborers in Athens wore. When he returned, Arcite and he put on\n",
      "the clothes and set out by the straight road to Athens.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Athens no one took any notice of the two poor men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before they came to the castle the squire left his master and found a house to live in, where\n",
      "he could do Arcite's bidding at any time. But Arcite hurried on to the courtyard gate. There\n",
      "he waited till the master of the servants who waited on Emelia came out. Then he said to him,\n",
      "\"Take me, I pray thee, into thy service. Drudge I will and draw water, yea, and in all thou\n",
      "dost command I will obey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The master of the servants asked Arcite what was his name. \"Philostrate, my lord,\" said Arcite,\n",
      "and as \"Philostrate\" he entered that part of the castle where Emelia's home was.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could hew wood and carry water well, but he was not long left to do such rough work. The\n",
      "master of the house saw that whatever he trusted to Philostrate's care was rightly done, so\n",
      "he gave him less humble work to do, and made him a page in the house of Emelia. The lords and\n",
      "ladies of the castle began to notice what a gentle and kind page this Philostrate was. They\n",
      "spoke to Theseus about him, and said that he deserved to have a higher place that he might\n",
      "show his goodness and courage in knightly deeds. To please them, Theseus made him one of his\n",
      "own squires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven years passed away, and Palamon was still in prison. This year, however, in the May-time,\n",
      "a friend of his, who heard where he was, helped him to escape. During the short night he fled\n",
      "as fast as he could, but when the early dawn began to break he strode tremblingly to a grove\n",
      "of trees, that he might hide there all day. When the darkness fell once more he meant to go\n",
      "on again to Thebes, there to gather his old armies to make war on Theseus. He wished either\n",
      "to win Emelia or to die. He cared little for his life if he might not spend it with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Palamon lay beside a bush in the grove, he watched the sunbeams drying up the dew drops\n",
      "on the leaves and flowers near him, and listened to the joyous song of a lark that poured forth\n",
      "its welcome to the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same lark that Palamon heard awakened Arcite. He was now the chief knight in the Duke's\n",
      "house, and served him with honor in peace and war. He sprang up and looked out on the fresh\n",
      "green fields. Everything called to him to come out. He loosed his horse from the stall and\n",
      "galloped over hill and dale. He came to the edge of a grove, and tied up his steed to a tree.\n",
      "Then he wandered down a woodland path to gather honeysuckle and hawthorn to weave a garland\n",
      "for himself. Little he thought of the snare into which he was walking. As he roamed he sang--\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"O May, of every month the queen,\n",
      "  With thy sweet flowers and forests green,\n",
      "  Right welcome be thou, fair fresh May.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The grove was the one in which Palamon lay beside a pool of water. When he heard the song of\n",
      "Arcite, cold fear took hold on him. He did not know that it was Arcite who sang, but he knew\n",
      "that the horse must belong to a knight of the court, and he crouched down to the ground lest\n",
      "he should be seen and taken back to prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Arcite's joyous mood passed away, and he grew sorrowful. He sighed and threw himself down\n",
      "not far from the spot where Palamon lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, alas!\" said Arcite, \"for the royal blood of Thebes! Alas that I should humbly serve\n",
      "my mortal enemy! Alas that I dare not claim my noble name, but must be known, forsooth, as\n",
      "Philostrate, a name worth not a straw! Of all our princely house not one is left save only\n",
      "me and Palamon, whom Theseus slays in prison. Even I, free though I am, am helpless to win\n",
      "Emelia. What am I to her but an humble squire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon was so angry when he heard this, that he forgot his own danger. He started out from\n",
      "his hiding-place and faced Arcite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"False Arcite,\" he cried, \"now art thou caught indeed! Thou hast deceived Duke Theseus and\n",
      "hast falsely changed thy name, hast thou? Then surely I or thou must die. I will suffer no\n",
      "man to love my lady, save myself alone. For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe. I have no weapon\n",
      "in this place, for only last night did I escape from prison. Yet I fear thee not. Thou shalt\n",
      "die, or thou shalt cease to love my lady. Choose as thou wilt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Arcite rose up in his wrath and drew his sword. He said, \"Were it not that thou art ill\n",
      "and mad with grief, and that thou hast no weapon here, thou shouldest never step from where\n",
      "thou standest. I deny the bond thou claimest! Fool! how can I help thee to win the lady I fain\n",
      "would wed myself? But because thou art a worthy knight and a gentle, and art ready to fight\n",
      "for thy lady, accept my promise. To-morrow I will not fail to wait for thee here without the\n",
      "knowledge of any other. Also I will bring armor and weapons for thee and me, and thou shalt\n",
      "choose of them what thou wilt, ere I arm myself! Food and drink will I bring to thee this night\n",
      "into the grove. If so be that thou slay me here to-morrow, then indeed thou mayest win thy\n",
      "lady if thou canst!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Palamon answered, \"Let it be so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning Arcite rode to the wood alone. He met Palamon on the woodland path where the flowers\n",
      "he had gathered the day before lay withered on the ground. No word nor greeting passed between\n",
      "them, but each helped to arm the other in silence. As the buckles were tightened and the armor\n",
      "slipped into its place, the color came and went in the faces of the two princes. They deemed\n",
      "that this would be the last of all fights to one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were ready they fenced together for a little, and then the real fight began. So fierce\n",
      "was it that the men seemed like wild animals in their rage. Palamon sprang at Arcite like a\n",
      "strong lion, and Arcite glanced aside and darted at him again like a cruel tiger. In the midst\n",
      "of this they heard a sound of the galloping of horses that brought the royal hunters to the\n",
      "spot. In a moment the sword of Theseus flashed between the fighters, and his voice thundered\n",
      "out, \"Ho! no more, on pain of death. Who are ye who dare to fight here alone, with none to\n",
      "see justice done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The princes turned and saw Theseus, Duke of Athens. Behind him rode Hippolyta with her sister,\n",
      "Emelia the Radiant, and many knights and ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon answered the Duke's question swiftly, before Arcite had time to speak. \"Sire, what\n",
      "need of words? Both of us deserve death. Two wretches are we, burdened with our lives. As thou\n",
      "art a just judge, give to us neither mercy nor refuge, but slay us both. Thou knowrest not\n",
      "that this knight, Philostrate, is thy mortal foe, whom thou hast banished. He is Arcite, who\n",
      "hath deceived thee for that he loveth Emelia. And I too love her. I too am thy mortal foe,\n",
      "for I am Palamon, and I have broken from my prison. Slay us then, here before fair Emelia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is easily granted,\" said Theseus. \"Ye judge yourselves. Ye shall die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the queen began to weep, and Emelia too. They were sad to think that these two princes\n",
      "should die so young, and all for the service they wished to do to the queen's sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other ladies of the court begged the Duke to forgive the fighters. \"Have mercy, sire,\"\n",
      "they urged, \"on us women, and save the princes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Theseus was too angry to listen to them, but soon he thought that he would have done\n",
      "as the princes had done, if he had been in their place, so he said, \"Arcite and Palamon, ye\n",
      "could both have lived in peace and safety in Thebes, yet love has brought you here to Athens\n",
      "into my power, who am your deadly foe. Here then for the sake of Hippolyta, my queen, and of\n",
      "Emelia the Radiant, our dear sister, I forgive you both. Promise never to make war on my land,\n",
      "but to yield me your friendship evermore.\" Joyfully the princes promised this, and thanked\n",
      "the Duke for his grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Theseus said, \"Both of you are noble. Either might wed Emelia the Radiant, but she cannot\n",
      "wed you both. Therefore I appoint a tournament in this place a year hence. Come here then,\n",
      "ye Princes of Thebes, each of you, with a hundred knights of the bravest, and that one of you,\n",
      "who shall slay or capture the other, he shall wed Emelia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose face could be brighter than was Palamon's when he heard those words, and who could step\n",
      "more lightly than did Arcite? Every one thanked the Duke for his kindness to the princes, while\n",
      "they rode off to Thebes with high hopes and light hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day of the tournament came, great buildings stood in a circle on the plain beside\n",
      "the grove. Within them stretched an immense arena in which the knights must fight. Great marble\n",
      "gates opened on to the space at either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon and Arcite found it easy to bring a hundred knights to Athens. So splendid were the\n",
      "preparations for the tournament that every one was eager to fight in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emelia alone was sad as the day of the fighting came nearer. Her maidens heard her say, \"Oh\n",
      "that I might not wed at all! I love the free life of the woods. I love to hunt, and to ride,\n",
      "and to roam. Why cannot Palamon and Arcite love each other as they used to do long ago, and\n",
      "leave me free?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the tournament Duke Theseus and his queen sat with Emelia on a high seat\n",
      "overlooking the lists. When the trumpet sounded, Arcite and his knights rode in through the\n",
      "western gate. His red banner shone bright against the white marble pillars. At the same moment\n",
      "Palamon entered from the east, and his white banner floated out against the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the heralds ceased galloping up and down, and the whole space was left to the warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trumpets sounded \"Advance,\" and the fray began. Through the bright sunshine they fought,\n",
      "advancing here, and beaten back there, till at last Palamon was hurled from his horse and taken\n",
      "prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trumpets sounded, and all stood still while Theseus called out, \"Ho! no more. All is over.\n",
      "Arcite of Thebes khall wed Emelia.\" Then the people shouted till it seemed that the great marble\n",
      "gates would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the eagerness of the fight Emelia had begun to like the warriors who fought for her, and\n",
      "her liking grew ever stronger as they showed their worth. When Arcite rode towards her with\n",
      "glowing face she was proud of him, and leant forward to welcome him gladly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he galloped, his horse started aside and he was thrown to the ground. He was too much\n",
      "hurt to rise. So he was lifted by his knights and carried to the palace. There he was cared\n",
      "for in every way, but nothing could save him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he died, he called for Emelia and Palamon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No words can tell the sorrow I bear because I must leave thee, my lady! Alas, death tears\n",
      "me from thee! Farewell, my wife! farewell, my Emelia! Ah, take me softly in thine arms, and\n",
      "listen while I speak! For years I have had strife with my dear cousin Palamon. Yet now I say\n",
      "to thee, in all this world I never have met with one so worthy to be loved as Palamon, that\n",
      "hath served thee, and will serve thee, his life long. Ah, if ever thou dost wed, let it be\n",
      "Palamon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice began to fail. \"Emelia!\" he said, and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emelia mourned sadly for her valiant knight. As for Palamon, all his old love for Arcite came\n",
      "back, and he wept for him as bitterly as he had bewailed his own sorrow in the dungeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the Greeks had ceased to mourn for Arcite, Palamon still grieved for the death of\n",
      "his friend, and for the strife that had been between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After two years Theseus sent one day for Palamon and Emelia. Palamon came to the court in his\n",
      "black robes of mourning; but Emelia was dressed in white, as she had been on the May morning\n",
      "in the garden years before. She had ceased to mourn for Arcite, and was Emelia the Radiant\n",
      "once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palamon caught his breath. He had not seen her since they parted after Arcite's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duke Theseus said, \"Sister, I desire thee now to take the noble knight Palamon to be thy husband.\n",
      "Have pity on his long service, and accept him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said to Palamon, \"It will not need much speech to gain thy consent! Come, take thy\n",
      "lady by the hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in the presence of all the court, they were wed. When all was over, Emelia fled from\n",
      "the noise and tumult of the hall, and beckoned to Palamon to follow. Out at the great hall\n",
      "doors she led him, and down the pathway to the garden beneath the tower. When he joined her,\n",
      "she pointed to the dungeon window, and told him of the day when she had looked at the prison\n",
      "in the morning mist, and murmured to herself the names of the captive princes, \"Palamon and\n",
      "Arcite, Palamon and Arcite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not till many years of joyous life had passed over their home that Palamon told\n",
      "Emelia that he had seen her first on that very morning when she had thought so sadly of his misery.\n",

      "GRISELDA\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time there lived a fair young girl whose name was Griselda. Her home was in an\n",
      "Italian village. There she dwelt in a lowly cottage with her father, Janicola. He was too old\n",
      "and weak to work for her, or even for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "All round the village lay the fruitful fields and vineyards of the plain, and on the slopes\n",
      "near grew olive-trees laden with fruit. Far in the distance rose the snow-capped mountains\n",
      "of the North.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in so rich a land it was not easy for this young Griselda to make her father's life as\n",
      "pleasant as she would have wished it to be. She lived plainly and barely. She was busy all\n",
      "day long. Now she was herding a few sheep on the broken ground near the village, and spinning\n",
      "as she watched her flock. Again she fetched the water from the well or gathered roots and herbs\n",
      "from which to make drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griselda was not unhappy though her life was hard, because she was so glad that she could serve\n",
      "her father and show her love to him, forgetting about herself and her own wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day as she sat watching her sheep her eyes fell on the white towers of a castle that stood\n",
      "not far from the village where she lived. It was the castle of the Marquis Walter, who was\n",
      "lord of all that land. Griselda looked kindly at the white towers. She thought that their master\n",
      "was the best and greatest man in the world. She knew that he was kind also, and courteous.\n",
      "When she saw him ride towards her, her face lighted up, and she rose to courtesy to him. She\n",
      "hoped he would draw up his horse beside her, and greet her, and ask for her father Janicola.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, as she looked at the castle, she saw a company of men hurrying along the road\n",
      "that led to its gate. Farmers were there in dull and homely clothes, and knights in armor that\n",
      "flashed back the sunlight, and lords in gay colors that glanced and gleamed among the olive-trees\n",
      "under the blue Italian sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griselda knew why they were going to Lord Walter, and she wondered what they would do and say\n",
      "when they reached him. She could not go after them, for her sheep would have wandered away\n",
      "if she had left them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the men that Griselda had watched reached the courtyard gate, they met Lord Walter. He\n",
      "was on horseback ready for the hunt. The foremost of the company prayed him to grant them a\n",
      "little time that they might tell him why they had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Walter threw the reins to a squire, and led his people into the great hall of the castle.\n",
      "There he seated himself in state to listen to their grievance whatever it might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the same man who had spoken before said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Noble Marquis, thy generous kindness in times past giveth us courage to come before thee.\n",
      "Truly, sire, thou and all thou dost art so dear to us that, save in one thing, we cannot wish\n",
      "for better fortune than to live under thy government. One thing alone disturbs the peace of\n",
      "thy faithful people. Though thou art young and strong, yet age creeps on! Time flies and waits\n",
      "for no man. Death threatens young and old alike. We pray thee, sire, that thou wilt wed, for\n",
      "if swift death should lay thee low ere a son be born to thee, then alack for us and for our\n",
      "children! In the power of a stranger then would lie our fair lands and even our lives. Grant\n",
      "us this boon, noble Marquis, and, if thou wilt, we will choose for thee a wife. Noble shall\n",
      "she be, and good, so that thou shalt have honor and gladness in thy wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Marquis said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My people, loyal and true, ye ask of me that which I thought not to grant, for the free life\n",
      "of the forest and the hunt pleaseth me well. Yet will I do this thing that ye desire. Only\n",
      "to me myself must fall the choice of her whom I will wed. On you I lay this command that, be\n",
      "she who she may, yet shall ye honor her as if she were an Emperor's daughter through all her\n",
      "life. Nor shall ye raise one word against the maiden of my choice. Unless ye agree to this,\n",
      "I will not wed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gladly the people promised. But ere they left the Marquis, they begged him to fix a day for\n",
      "the marriage lest he should put off too long. The Marquis granted their request, and farmers,\n",
      "knights, and lords trooped joyfully home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the morning of the day that was fixed for the wedding came, the castle of the Marquis\n",
      "was gaily decorated. Flags floated out from the towers, and garlands trailed over the doorway\n",
      "and the gate. Within in the great hall a royal feast was spread, and there lay royal robes\n",
      "and gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the courtyard and on the terraces lords and ladies stood in groups. Wonder and doubt were\n",
      "on every face. The wedding-feast was prepared, the guests were come, but there was no bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "A trumpet sounded \"to horse,\" and all was hurry and noise. Then Lord Walter rode out through\n",
      "the castle gate. He was followed by bearers, who carried the beautiful robes and gems that\n",
      "had lain in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode out by the same road along which Griselda had watched the people go to ask the Marquis\n",
      "to wed, many months before. Now she saw the bridal train ride down from the castle. \"Ah,\" she\n",
      "said, \"they ride this way to fetch the bride. I shall work more busily than ever to-day that\n",
      "I may be free to stand and watch Lord Walter's fair bride as the riders return with her to\n",
      "the castle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went to the well to fetch water. When she came back she found Lord Walter at her father's\n",
      "door. In the narrow lane beside the cottage stood lords and ladies, while their horses impatiently\n",
      "pawed the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly Griselda set her pitcher in a trough near the cottage door, and knelt before the Marquis\n",
      "to hear his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is thy father?\" Lord Walter asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Close at hand, my Lord,\" said Griselda, and went to bring him without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My faithful servant,\" said Lord Walter to the old man, \"grant me thy daughter for my wife!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Janicola knew not what to say for surprise. At last he answered, \"My will is thine! Do as thou\n",
      "wilt, my own dear Lord!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then must I ask Griselda if she will be my wife; but stay thou by us. Thou shalt hear her answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Griselda was amazed. She did not know what the meaning of Lord Walter's visit was, and when\n",
      "she stood before him her face was full of fear. Her wonder was very great when she heard him say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Griselda, I am come for thee. Thee only will I wed. Thy father also is willing. But ere thou\n",
      "tell me whether or no thou wilt be my bride, listen to the demand I make. Art thou ready to\n",
      "obey me in everything, and to let me do to thee evil or good as I will without so much as turning\n",
      "to me a frowning face?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed a strange request to Grisdda, but she loved and trusted Lord Walter so truly that\n",
      "she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord, I am not worthy of this honor. Verily in all things thy will shall be mine. Life is\n",
      "sweet, but I will die rather than displease thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Enough, Griselda!\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Lord Walter turned to the courtiers and the people of the village who had gathered round:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold my wife! Let all show their love to me by the honor and love they bear to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies of the court were commanded to take off Griselda's old clothes and to array her\n",
      "in the costly robes they had brought with them. They did not like to touch the poor soiled\n",
      "clothes she wore, nor to move about in the little cottage with their sweeping gowns; but the\n",
      "gentleness of Griselda made it pleasant to help her. They caught up Griselda's royal robes\n",
      "with great clasps of gold set with gems, and put a crown on her beautiful hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She came out and stood in the low doorway, where she had so often stood before. But now the\n",
      "people scarcely knew her: she looked so fair in her new robes and with the love-light shining\n",
      "in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Walter did not wait till he reached the castle. He was married to Griselda at her father's\n",
      "cottage door. The villagers gathered round and gazed at the simple wedding. They saw Lord Walter\n",
      "put a great ring on Griselda's finger, and lift her on to a milk-white steed. Then they led\n",
      "her with joy towards the castle. Wedding-bells rang out gladly across the plain, and ever as\n",
      "the wedding-party drew near to the white towers with their floating flags, happy bands of people\n",
      "came to meet and welcome Griselda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the fame of Lord Walter's beautiful wife spread through the land. Nor was it only\n",
      "for her beauty that men praised her. Gracious she was and wise, able to rule her home, and\n",
      "to bend fiery spirits to her will.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all the countryside men came to her in trouble. Every one rejoiced in the good fortune\n",
      "that had come to their land, and some even called her an angel from heaven come to right all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time a daughter was born to Griselda. Then she thought she was the happiest woman\n",
      "in the world. She thought of the care that she would give her child as she grew up, and of\n",
      "Lord Walter's delight in his little daughter when the time should come that she could talk\n",
      "and ride with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before the baby was a year old, all Griselda's dreams were broken. Lord Walter said to\n",
      "himself, \"It is easy for Griselda to keep her promise when I ask of her nothing that is not\n",
      "just and right. How can I trust her until I know that she will obey me in everything? I wonder\n",
      "whether she would be patient still if I hurt our little daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These thoughts came back to his mind so often that at last he resolved to try Griselda's patience\n",
      "by taking away her baby from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening Griselda was playing with her little child. The baby laughed in her arms and looked\n",
      "sweeter than ever. At that moment the curtain at the doorway was drawn aside and Lord Walter\n",
      "came into the room. His face was sad and drawn, and as Griselda looked up at him she feared\n",
      "that some great blow had fallen on him, or that some enemy had entered the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Walter said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Griselda, thou hast not forgotten the day on which I brought thee from thy father's lowly\n",
      "cottage to this my castle. Although thou art most dear to me, thou art not dear to my nobles.\n",
      "They say that it is hard that they should serve one so lowly born as thou. Since thy daughter\n",
      "was born they have said this more and more, I doubt not. As thou knowest, my will is to live\n",
      "with my people in joy and peace. Therefore must I do to my child not as I wish myself, but\n",
      "as my nobles wish. Show then to me the obedience that thou didst promise to show when thou\n",
      "wert wed in the village street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Griselda heard these words she made no moan. Neither did she let the pain that caught at\n",
      "her heart be seen in her face. When she could speak, she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord, we are thine! My child is thine. I also am thine. With thine own thou mayest ever do\n",
      "as pleaseth thee best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marquis was full of joy because of the patience and humbleness of Griselda; but he appeared\n",
      "to be sad, and left her with a troubled face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this, Griselda started as she heard a heavy footstep on the stairway. Then an evil-looking\n",
      "man walked into the quiet room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" he said, \"I must obey my lord's will. He bids me take this child. Thou knowest we\n",
      "must obey, although we may complain and mourn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the soldier took the child so roughly that it seemed as if he would kill it before her.\n",
      "Griselda said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, sir, do thou suffer me to kiss my child ere it die.\" He gave it back to her. Gently\n",
      "she gathered it in her arms. She blessed it, and lulled it, and kissed it. Then she said in\n",
      "her sweet voice: \"Farewell, my child, I shall see thee never again. The blessing of Him who\n",
      "died on a cross of wood for us, rest on thee. To Him I give thy soul, my little one! To-night\n",
      "thou must die because of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To the rough soldier she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take again the child and obey my Lord. But if it please my Lord, then of thy kindness bury\n",
      "thou the little body where no cruel bird nor beast can harm it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But in silence the soldier carried away the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Lord Walter looked to see if Griselda would fret or be less kind to him. He watched, but\n",
      "could see no change in her. She was as busy and loving and cheerful as ever. Neither in earnest\n",
      "nor in play did she name her child.\n",
      "\n",
      "After four years a son was born to Griselda. The people were very glad because there was now\n",
      "an heir to rule the land at the death of Lord Walter. Griselda too was happy, though her heart\n",
      "longed for the little maid who might have been playing with her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the boy was two years old, Lord Walter began to wish once more to try the patience of\n",
      "Griselda.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time he said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wife, I have told thee before how ill the people bear our marriage. Now that a son is born\n",
      "they are more wrathful than before. My heart is weary with the thought of their complaints.\n",
      "They say, 'When Lord Walter is gone, the grandson of Janicola shall rule us!' Therefore I shall\n",
      "do with my son as I did with his sister. Be patient, I pray thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou art my Lord,\" said Griselda. \"My will and my freedom lie in my father's cottage with\n",
      "the poor soiled clothes I left there on the day thou didst bring me hither. Could I know thy\n",
      "will before thou didst tell it to me, it would be done, though it were death to do it. Life\n",
      "cannot compare with thy love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Walter looked down to the ground. He could not look at his wife lest he should not have\n",
      "heart to do as he wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the rude soldier came to Griselda. He was even harsher than before, and carried off the\n",
      "child without a kind word to the patient mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the little boy was gone, the people said very bitter things about Lord Walter. The love\n",
      "they had given him before was turned into hatred because he had treated his beautiful wife\n",
      "so unkindly, and because he had murdered his children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Lord Walter saw this, he wished to try his wife once more. He knew that he could send\n",
      "away his wife and marry another if he got a letter from the Pope to say that he might. He sent\n",
      "a messenger to Rome, where the Pope lived. This messenger was told to bring back a letter,\n",
      "not from the Pope, but as like one of his as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter came. It said that because of the anger of Lord Walter's people at the lowly birth\n",
      "of his wife Griselda, the Marquis might send her away and marry another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of the letter spread throughout the land. Every one believed that it had really come\n",
      "from the Pope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griselda's heart was very sore when she heard of this letter. But she went on quietly with\n",
      "each day's work. She did not even speak of the letter to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Lord Walter spoke before all his court, and with no knightly gentleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Griselda,\" he said, \"there is no freedom in the life of one who rules. I may not act after\n",
      "my own wish as any laborer on my land may do. As thou knowest, my people hate thy presence,\n",
      "and demand of me that I wed another. The Pope's letter thou hast heard. Return then, swiftly\n",
      "and without complaint, to thy father's cottage, for already my bride cometh hither.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Lord, it is no new thought to me, that I am unworthy to be thy servant--far more unworthy\n",
      "to be thy wife. In this great house of which thou didst make me queen, I have not acted as\n",
      "mistress, but only as lowly handmaid to thee. For these years of thy kindness, I thank thee.\n",
      "Gladly do I go to my father's house. There he tended me when I was but a child. Now I will\n",
      "stay with him till death enters the cottage door. To thee and to thy bride be joy. To her I\n",
      "willingly yield the place where I have been so happy. Since thou, who once wert all my joy,\n",
      "wilt have me go, I go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Walter turned away in sadness. He could scarcely speak for pity, but he held to his purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Griselda drew her wedding-ring from her finger, and laid it down. Beside it she put the\n",
      "gems that Lord Walter had given her. Her beautiful robes she laid aside. In the simplest gown\n",
      "she could find, and with head and feet all bare, Griselda went down through the olive trees\n",
      "towards her father's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of Lord Walter's people followed her, weeping and bewailing the fickleness of fortune.\n",
      "Griselda did not turn to them, nor speak, nor weep. She quietly went on her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tidings reached her father, he wished that he had never been born, so sad was he in\n",
      "the sorrow of his beautiful daughter. He hastened out to meet her, and wrapped her tenderly\n",
      "in her old cloak, and led her home with tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griselda spoke no word of complaint, nor did she speak of her former happiness. Once more she\n",
      "tended the sheep on the common. Once more she carried water from the well. Once more she thought\n",
      "first of her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some weeks Lord Walter sent for Griselda. She went to the castle and greeted him humbly\n",
      "as of old. She showed no grudge because of his unkindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Griselda,\" he said, \"thou knowest, as doth no other, how all this castle should be ordered\n",
      "for my pleasure. Stay thou then, and have all in readiness for the fair young bride whom I\n",
      "shall wed to-morrow. It is my will that she be welcomed royally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My whole desire is to serve thee, my Lord. Neither weal nor woe shall ever make me cease to\n",
      "love thee with all my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At once Griselda took control of all who worked in the castle. Of them all she was the neatest\n",
      "and the quickest. Soon every room in the tower was sweet and clean. The great hall was decked\n",
      "for the wedding-feast, and the table glittered with silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early next morning many horsemen came to the castle. Among them was a beautiful girl dressed\n",
      "in a shimmering white robe. Near her rode a charming boy younger than the maiden. Round them\n",
      "were many nobles, and a guard of soldiers, who had brought them to Lord Walter's court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people crowded round the gates. So charmed were they with the fair young maid, that some\n",
      "of them forgot their love for Griselda, and were ready to welcome the bride whose coming caused\n",
      "her so much sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Griselda moved about the castle in her old worn clothes. She went to the gate to welcome\n",
      "the bride. Then she received the guests and greeted each of them according to his degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger nobles wondered who Griselda could be. She was so wise and gentle, and yet so\n",
      "meanly dressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the feast began, Lord Walter called Griselda to him. Then he asked her, \"What dost thou\n",
      "think of my wife? Is she beautiful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never have I seen a fairer,\" said Griselda. \"Joy be with you both evermore! But oh! I beg\n",
      "of thee, torment not this child as thou didst me. She has been tenderly cared for. She could\n",
      "not bear what I have borne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lord Walter saw her great patience, and thought of the pain he had caused her, his heart\n",
      "went out to her in great pity, and he cried, \"It is enough, Griselda; fear no more, nor be\n",
      "thou longer sad. I have tried thy faith and thy sweetness, as faith and sweetness have never\n",
      "before been tried.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His arms were around her, and he kissed her. Griselda looked at him in wonder. She could not\n",
      "understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Griselda,\" he said, \"thou art my wife. I have no other. This is thy daughter; her brother\n",
      "is my heir. Thine are they both. Take them again, and dream not that thou art bereft of thy\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Griselda heard all this she fainted away in her great joy. When she woke again she called\n",
      "her children to her. Timidly they came, but soon they were caught close to her breast. While\n",
      "she fondled them, and kissed them, her hot tears of joy fell on their fair faces, and on their\n",
      "hair. Then she looked at Lord Walter, and said, \"Death cannot harm me now, since thou lovest\n",
      "me still.\" Then she turned back to the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh tender, oh dear, oh little ones, my children! Your sorrowful mother thought that cruel\n",
      "dogs or other fearsome beasts had torn you! but God has kept you safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again the ladies of the court dressed Griselda in royal robes. Once again they set a golden\n",
      "crown upon her head. Once again the wedding-ring slipped into its own place on her finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere she entered the hall of feasting again, swift messengers had brought her old father, Janicola,\n",
      "to the castle, never to leave it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Griselda sat with her children beside her husband. To her feet came lords and nobles,\n",
      "peasants and farmers, eager to kiss her hand and to show the joy they felt in her return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had the walls of the castle reechoed the laughter of so glad a people. All day long till\n",
      "the stars shone in the cool clear sky the feasting went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Griselda this was the first of many happy days, happier than she had known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her home sounded the gay voices of happy children as they played with, and cared for, the\n",
      "old grandfather whom their mother loved so dearly. And ever as she moved about the castle she\n",
      "met the eyes of Lord Walter, that told her again and yet again that he trusted her utterly.\n",
      "His fear was so great that he brake out with a mournful cry, saying, \"What shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this plight therefore he went home, and did all he could to hide his distress from his wife\n",
      "and children. But he could not be silent long, because his trouble increased. Wherefore at\n",
      "length he began to talk to his wife and children thus: \"O my dear wife,\" said he, \"and you\n",
      "my children, I am in despair by reason of a burden that lieth heavy on me. Moreover I am for\n",
      "certain told that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven, when both myself, with\n",
      "thee, my wife, and you, my sweet babes, shall be ruined, except some way of escape can be found.\"\n",
      "At this his wife and children were sore amazed, not because they believed that what he had\n",
      "said to them was true, but because they thought he must be ill to talk in so strange a way.\n",
      "He told them, \"Worse and worse,\" and began to talk to them again in the same strange manner,\n",
      "but they began to be careless of his words. They also thought to drive away his fancies by\n",
      "harsh and rough behavior to him. Sometimes they would mock, sometimes they would scold, and\n",
      "sometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began to stay in his room to pray for\n",
      "and pity them, and also to comfort his own misery. He would also walk alone in the fields,\n",
      "sometimes reading and sometimes praying, and thus for some days he spent his time. And I find\n",
      "I am not willing to die, nor able to be judged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Evangelist, \"Why not willing to die, since in this life you are so unhappy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man answered, \"Because I fear this burden will sink me lower than the grave, and the thought\n",
      "of that makes me cry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Evangelist, \"If this be thy fear, why standest thou still?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered, \"Because I know not whither to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the man, \"Neighbors, wherefore are you come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you seek, since you leave all the world to find it?\" said Obstinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seek a treasure that never fades away. It is laid up in heaven and is safe there,\" said\n",
      "Christian. \"Read it so, if you will, in my book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tush!\" said Obstinate, \"away with your book. Will you go back with us or no?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not I,\" said the other, \"because I have just set out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come then, Neighbor Pliable, let us turn again and go home without him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Pliable, \"If what the good Christian says is true, the things he looks after are\n",
      "better than ours. My heart makes me wish to go with him. But, my good Christian, do you know\n",
      "the way you are going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist, to speed me to a little gate that is before\n",
      "us, where we shall be told about the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come then, good neighbor,\" said Pliable, \"let us be going.\" Then they went both together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I will go back to my place,\" said Obstinate. \"I will tell you what my book says of the\n",
      "country to which we are going, and of the people we shall meet there,\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do you think the words of your book are certainly true?\" said Pliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Christian, \"for it was written by Him who cannot lie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Pliable, \"tell me about this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In this country,\" said Christian, \"we shall live for ever. There are crowns of glory to be\n",
      "given us, and garments that will make us shine like the sun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is excellent,\" said Pliable; \"and what else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There shall be no more crying nor sorrow, for He that is the Owner of the place will wipe\n",
      "all tears from our eyes,\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what companions shall we have there?\" asked Pliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There we shall be with those that will dazzle your eyes to look on. There also you shall meet\n",
      "with thousands and tens of thousands that have gone before us to that place. None of of them\n",
      "are hurtful, but loving and holy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as Pliable heard of the excellence of the country and of the company to which they were\n",
      "going, he said, \"Well, my good companion, glad I am to hear of these things. Come on, let us\n",
      "go with more speed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot go as fast as I would by reason of this burden that is on my back,\" said Christian.\n",
      "If I get out again with my life, you shall possess the wonderful country alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you not look for the steps?\" said Help.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was so full of fear,\" answered Christian, \"that I fled the next way and fell in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Help, \"Give me thy hand.\" So Christian gave him his hand, and he drew him out and\n",
      "set him upon sound ground, and bid him go on his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in my dream I stepped up to the man that plucked Christian out, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, wherefore, since over this place is the way from the City of Destruction to the Wicket-gate,\n",
      "is it that this Slough is not mended, that poor travelers might go over in more safety?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he said to me, \"This place cannot be mended, yet it is not the pleasure of the King that\n",
      "it should remain so bad. His laborers also have for more than sixteen hundred years been employed\n",
      "on this patch of ground, in the hope that it might perhaps be mended. There has been swallowed\n",
      "up here twenty thousand cartloads of the best material in the attempt to mend the place. But\n",
      "it is the Slough of Despond still; and still will be so, when they have done all they can.\n",
      "It is true that there are some good and strong steps even through the very midst of this mire.\n",
      "Others again did mock at his cowardliness, saying, \"Surely since you began to go, you need\n",
      "not have been so base as to have given out for a few difficulties.\" So Pliable sat like a coward\n",
      "among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as Christian was walking alone, he espied one afar off, come crossing over the field to\n",
      "meet him. The gentleman's name was Mr. Worldly Wiseman. He dwelt in a very great town, close\n",
      "by the one from which Christian came. This man, then, meeting with Christian, began thus to\n",
      "enter into some talk with him: \"How now, good fellow, whither are you going in this burdened\n",
      "manner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A burdened manner indeed,\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take that pleasure in them as formerly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you hearken to me if I give thee counsel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it be good, I will, for I stand in need of good counsel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what I seek for, even to be rid of this heavy burden, but get it off myself I cannot,\n",
      "nor is there any man living in our country who can take it off my shoulders. Therefore I am\n",
      "going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of my burden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man that appeared to me a very great and honorable person. His name, as I remember, is Evangelist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has given thee foolish counsel. There is not a more dangerous and troublesome way in the\n",
      "world than is that unto which he hath directed thee. Thou hast met with some danger already,\n",
      "for I see the mud of the Slough of Despond is upon thee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, I pray that thou wilt tell me this secret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, in yonder village there dwells a gentleman, who is very wise, and who has skill to help\n",
      "men off with burdens like thine from their shoulders. To him thou mayest go to be helped at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Christian puzzled, but he thought, \"If what Mr. Worldly Wiseman says is true, my wisest\n",
      "plan is to take his advice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Christian, \"which is my way to this honest man's house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you see yonder high hill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By that hill you must go, and the first house you come to is his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Christian turned out of his way to go to the house for help. But behold, when he was now\n",
      "close to the hill, it seemed so steep, and also that side of it that was next the wayside did\n",
      "hang so much over, that Christian was afraid to venture farther, lest the hill should fall\n",
      "on his head. Wherefore he stood still, and knew not what to do. Here therefore he did quake\n",
      "for fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Christian, \"I am the man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I not direct thee the way to the little Wicket-gate?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned out of the way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I met with a gentleman as soon as I had got over the Slough of Despond, who told me that in\n",
      "yonder village I might find a man who could take off my burden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was he like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me, and got me at last to believe his words.\n",
      "So I came hither, but when I beheld this hill and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly stood\n",
      "still lest it should fall on my head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What said that gentleman to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, he asked me whither I was going, and if I had a wife and children, and he bid me make\n",
      "speed to get rid of my burden. And I said, 'I am going to yonder gate to be told how I may\n",
      "get rid of it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So he said he would show me a better and a shorter way, and not so full of difficulties as\n",
      "the way that you directed me. But when I came to this place, I stopped for fear of danger,\n",
      "and now I know not what to do!\" So Christian stood trembling before Evangelist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Evangelist, \"Give heed to the things I shall tell thee. Mr. Worldly Wiseman sought\n",
      "to turn thee out of the way and to bring thee into danger. In yonder village has no man ever\n",
      "yet got rid of his burden, nor is he ever likely to lose it there. Therefore, Mr. Worldly Wiseman\n",
      "and his friend are deceivers, and cannot help thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After this there came words and fire out of the mountain under which Christian stood. Now Christian\n",
      "looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out, saying he would he had never met Mr. Worldly\n",
      "Wiseman or that he had never listened to him. Then he turned to Evangelist and said, \"Sir,\n",
      "what do you think? Is there any hope? May I now go back and go up to the Wicket-gate? Or shall\n",
      "I be sent back from the gate ashamed? I am sorry I have listened to this man's counsel, but\n",
      "may my sins be forgiven?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evangelist said to him, \"Thy sin is very great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then did Christian prepare to go back. And Evangelist, after he had kissed him, gave him one\n",
      "smile, and bid him Godspeed. So Christian went on with haste, neither spake he to any man by\n",
      "the way. Even if any one spoke to him, he would not venture an answer. At last there came a\n",
      "grave person to the gate, named Good-will. He asked who was there, and whence he came, and\n",
      "what he desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a sinner,\" said Christian; \"I come from the City of Destruction, but am going to Mount\n",
      "Zion. I am told that by this gate is the way thither, and I would know if you are willing to\n",
      "let me in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am willing with all my heart,\" said Good-will, and he opened the gate. So when Christian\n",
      "was stepping in, the other gave him a pull.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you do that?\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Good-will told him, \"A little distance from this gate a strong castle has been built,\n",
      "of which Beelzebub is the captain. And he and those that are with him shoot arrows at those\n",
      "that come up to this gate, hoping they may die before they enter in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So when Christian had come in, Good-will asked him who had directed him to the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Evangelist bid me come here and knock, as I did. And he said that you, sir, would tell me\n",
      "what I must do.\" This is the way thou must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Christian, \"are there no turnings, nor windings, by which a stranger may lose his way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there are many ways join this, but they are crooked and wide. Thou mayest know the right\n",
      "from the wrong way, for the right way is always strait and narrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him if he could not help him off with his burden\n",
      "that was upon his back. For as yet he had not got rid of it, nor could he get it off without\n",
      "help. But Good-will said, \"Thou must be content to bear it, until thou comest to a place where\n",
      "stands a Cross, for there it will fall from thy back of itself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Christian began to get ready to continue his journey. Then Christian took leave of his\n",
      "friend, and he again bid him Godspeed. Now Christian went on till he came to the house of the\n",
      "Interpreter, where he knocked over and over. At last one came to the door and asked who was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Christian, \"I am a traveler who was told by Good-will to call here. He had eyes\n",
      "lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and a crown of gold did hang over his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Christian, \"What means this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man whose picture this is,\" answered the Interpreter, \"is one of a thousand. And when\n",
      "this was done the room was swept and cleansed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Christian, \"What does this mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interpreter answered, \"This parlor is like the heart of an evil man. The dust is his sin,\n",
      "and the damsel that sprinkles the water is the Gospel.\" But afterwards the Interpreter took\n",
      "him to the back of the wall, where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, and he poured\n",
      "the oil continually, but secretly, into the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does this mean?\" asked Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interpreter answered, \"The fire is a picture of the grace God puts into the heart. He that\n",
      "casts water on it to put it out is the Evil One. And the man who pours oil on the fire to keep\n",
      "it alight is Christ.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Christian, \"May we go in here?\" So the Interpreter took him and led him toward the\n",
      "door of the palace. Now before they came up to the door, they passed a man, sitting at a table,\n",
      "with a book and his inkhorn before him, to take down the name of any who should enter. And,\n",
      "behold, at the door stood a great company of men, who wished to go in, but did not dare to\n",
      "enter, for within the doorway stood many men in armor to guard it. Now, these men in armor\n",
      "were determined to do any who would enter as much harm and mischief as they could. Christian\n",
      "was amazed. The armed men fought with great strength, but the man with the strong face was\n",
      "not at all discouraged, but fought most fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Interpreter said, \"Hast thou understood these things?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Christian, and he began to get ready to go on his journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Interpreter, \"God be always with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way\n",
      "that leads to Mount Zion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I saw in my dream that the highway up which Christian was to go was fenced on either side\n",
      "with a wall. So I saw in my dream that just as Christian came up to the Cross his burden fell\n",
      "from off his back, and began to tumble till it came to the mouth of the Sepulcher, where it\n",
      "fell in and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad and happy, and he stood for a while to\n",
      "look and wonder, for it was surprising to him to see that the Cross should make him lose his\n",
      "burden. Now as he stood looking, behold three Shining Ones came to him and greeted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first said to him, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee.\" The second took away all his rags and clothed\n",
      "him in new raiment. I saw then in my dream that as he walked he saw two men come tumbling over\n",
      "the wall into the narrow way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen, where do you come from and whither do you go?\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "They told him, \"We were born in a land called Vainglory, and we are going to Mount Zion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why came you not in at the gate?\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said that to go to the gate was too far, so they had taken a short cut and climbed over\n",
      "the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Christian, \"will the Lord of the City to which we are going be pleased that you\n",
      "should come into the way over the wall?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the men said he need not trouble his head about that, for what they did had been done many\n",
      "times before. It had been a custom for more than a thousand years. And besides, said they,\n",
      "\"If we get into the way, what does it matter how we get in? You came in by the Wicket-gate,\n",
      "and are in the way, and we came tumbling over the wall and are in the way, so now we are all\n",
      "in the same condition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Christian, \"I walk by the Rule of my Master, and you walk just as you like best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said they, \"We see not how thou art different to us, except by the coat thou wearest,\n",
      "and that, we suppose, was given thee by some of thy neighbors, to hide thy rags.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Christian, \"the Lord of the City to which I go gave me this coat the day that\n",
      "he took away from me my rags. He will surely know me, since I have His coat on my back. I have\n",
      "also a mark in my forehead, which you may not have noticed, and this was given to me by one\n",
      "of my Lord's friends, on the day my burden fell off my shoulders. I will tell you too, that\n",
      "I had a roll given me, to comfort me by reading, as I go on the way. I am also to give in the\n",
      "roll at the Celestial Gate. All these things I think you are without, because you came not\n",
      "in at the gate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To these things they gave him no answer, only they looked at each other and laughed. I beheld\n",
      "then, that they all went on without talking much together, till they came to the foot of the\n",
      "hill Difficulty, at the bottom of which was a spring. The narrow way lay right up the hill,\n",
      "but there were also two other ways here. One turned to the left hand and the other to the right\n",
      "at the bottom of the hill. Christian now went to the spring and drank to refresh himself, and\n",
      "then began to go up the narrow path that led to the top of the hill. The other two also came\n",
      "to the foot of the hill. But when they saw that the hill was steep and high, they made up their\n",
      "minds to go in the other paths that lay round the side of the hill. When Christian got there\n",
      "he sat down to rest, then he pulled out his roll and read in it to comfort himself, and he\n",
      "began again to look at the garment that was given to him at the Cross. The name of the one\n",
      "was Timorous, and the other Mistrust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Christian, \"You make me afraid, but yet I will go forward.\" So Mistrust and Timorous\n",
      "ran down the hill, and Christian went on his way. And as he went he thought again of what he\n",
      "heard from the men. At last he bethought himself that he had slept in the arbor that was on\n",
      "the side of the hill, and then he went back to look for his roll. But all the way he went back,\n",
      "who can tell the sorrow of Christian's heart? Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept, and often\n",
      "he chid himself for being so foolish as to fall asleep. Thus therefore he went back, carefully\n",
      "looking on this side and on that all the way as he went. For he hoped to find the roll that\n",
      "had been his comfort so many times in his journey. And as he went towards the arbor, he sighed\n",
      "over his sleepiness, saying, \"Oh, foolish man that I was, why did I sleep in the daytime? oh,\n",
      "that I had not slept.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by the time he was come to the arbor again, for a while he sat down and wept, but, at\n",
      "last, looking sorrowfully down under the settle, he espied his roll, which with trembling haste\n",
      "he caught up. But who can tell how joyful Christian was when he had got his roll again, or\n",
      "with what joy and tears he began to go up the hill again. And, oh, how nimbly did he go up!\n",
      "Yet before he reached the top the sun went down. Now Christian remembered the story that Mistrust\n",
      "and Timorous had told him, how they were frightened with the sight of the lions. And he said\n",
      "to himself, \"If these beasts meet me in the dark, how shall I escape being by them torn in\n",
      "pieces?\" Now before he had gone far, he entered into a very narrow passage; and looking before\n",
      "him as he went, he espied two lions in the way. The lions were chained, but Christian did not\n",
      "see the chains. Then he was afraid and thought he would go back, but the porter at the lodge,\n",
      "whose name is Watchful, seeing Christian stop, as if he would go back, cried, \"Fear not the\n",
      "lions, for they are chained.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Watchful the porter rang a bell, at the sound of which a grave and beautiful damsel came\n",
      "out of the door. When she saw Christian she brought him into the Palace Beautiful, and she\n",
      "and her sisters talked with him until supper was ready. Now all their talk at table was about\n",
      "the Lord of the hill, and, by what they said, I knew that He had been a great Warrior, and\n",
      "that He had fought and slain Death, but not without great danger to Himself, which made me\n",
      "love Him the more. They talked together till late at night, and after they had committed themselves\n",
      "to their Lord for protection, they went to bed. The room in which the pilgrim slept had a window\n",
      "opening towards the sunrising, and the name of the room was Peace. In the morning they all\n",
      "got up, and after some more talk, they told him that they would take him to the armory before\n",
      "he left them. So they did, and when he came out, he was harnessed from head to foot, lest he\n",
      "should be attacked in the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Christian, \"I know him. He comes from the place where I was born. How far do you\n",
      "think he has got?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By this time he is below the hill,\" said the porter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Christian began to go down the hill into the Valley of Humiliation, where it is difficult\n",
      "not to slip. He went down very warily, yet he slipped once or twice. Now in the valley Christian\n",
      "had a hard fight with a fiend called Apollyon. Apollyon was a monster and hideous to behold.\n",
      "He was clothed with scales like a fish, he had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear, and his\n",
      "mouth was as the mouth of a lion, and out of it came fire and smoke. When he came up to Christian\n",
      "he looked at him with rage in his face, and said, \"Prepare thyself to die, for thou shalt go\n",
      "no farther.\" And he threw a flaming dart at him, but Christian had a shield in his hand, which\n",
      "caught the dart, so that it did him no harm. Then did Christian draw his sword, but Apollyon\n",
      "threw darts at him as thick as hail, and wounded him in his head, his hand, and foot. This\n",
      "great combat lasted half a day, till Christian was almost worn out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Apollyon came close to Christian, and wrestled with him and gave him a dreadful fall,\n",
      "and Christian's sword flew out of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of thee now,\" said Apollyon. But while he was taking a last blow to kill this good\n",
      "man altogether, Christian nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword, and caught it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the battle was over, Christian said, \"I will give thanks to Him that did help me against\n",
      "Apollyon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He also sat down in that place to eat and drink, so being refreshed, he again began his journey,\n",
      "with his sword drawn in his hand, \"For,\" said he, \"I do not know if some other enemy may not\n",
      "be at hand.\" Now this valley is a very lonely place. It is like a wilderness or a desert full\n",
      "of pits. No man dwells in it, and no man but a Christian passeth through it. Here Christian\n",
      "had a worse time than even in his fight with Apollyon. I saw then in my dream that when Christian\n",
      "had reached the borders of this valley, there met him two men, making haste to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christian said to them, \"Whither are you going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Back, back,\" they cried, \"as you will go, if you prize life or peace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what is the matter?\" said Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Matter!\" said they. \"We were going the way you are going, and we went as far as we dared.\n",
      "But had we gone a little farther we had not been here to bring the news to thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what have you met with?\" said Christian. Death also doth always spread his wings over\n",
      "it. In a word, it is altogether dreadful, being utterly without order.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Christian, \"this is the way to the Celestial City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be it your way, then; we will not choose it for ours.\" So they parted. Christian went on his\n",
      "way, but still with his sword drawn in his hand, lest he should be attacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw then in my dream, that as far as this valley reached, there was on the right hand a very\n",
      "deep ditch. Again, behold, on the left hand, there was a very dangerous mire, into which if\n",
      "a man falls he finds no bottom for his foot to stand on. The pathway here was also exceeding\n",
      "narrow, and therefore Christian was the more distressed. For when he sought in the dark to\n",
      "shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tumble over into the mire on the other, and\n",
      "when he sought to escape the mire, without great carefulness he would nearly fall into the\n",
      "ditch. Then he went on, and I heard him sigh bitterly. For besides these dangers, the pathway\n",
      "was here so dark, that when he lifted up his foot to go forward, he knew not where, nor upon\n",
      "what he should set it next. Sometimes he thought he would go back, but again he thought he\n",
      "might be half-way through the valley. So he resolved to go on, yet the fiends seemed to come\n",
      "nearer and nearer. But when they were come almost close to him, he cried out in a loud voice,\n",
      "\"I will walk in the strength of the Lord God.\" Then the fiends went back and came no farther.\n",
      "Then he was glad, for he thought that some one who feared God was in this valley, as well as\n",
      "himself, and he hoped to overtake him and have company by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now morning being come, he looked back to see by the light of day what dangers he had gone\n",
      "through in the night. So he saw more plainly the ditch that was on the one hand, and the mire\n",
      "that was on the other, also how narrow the way was that lay between them both. He saw, too,\n",
      "the hobgoblins and dragons, but all afar off, for after break of day they came not nigh. In\n",
      "this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as Christian went on his way, he came to a little hill, and going up he looked forward\n",
      "and saw Faithful before him. Then said Christian, \"Stay, and I will be your companion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he overtook Faithful they went very lovingly on together, and talked of all that had\n",
      "happened to them in their pilgrimage.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this fair there were sold houses, lands, trades, husbands, wives, children, silver, gold,\n",
      "pearls, and precious stones. And, moreover, at this fair, there were at all times cheats and\n",
      "jugglers and knaves and rogues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way to the Celestial City lay just through this town, so the pilgrims had to go through\n",
      "the fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince of princes Himself, when here, went through this town to his own country, and that\n",
      "on a fair-day too. And, I think, it was Beelzebub the chief lord of this fair that invited\n",
      "the Prince to buy of his vanities. Beelzebub even said he would have made Him lord of the fair,\n",
      "if He would have done him reverence as He went through the town. Yea, because the Prince was\n",
      "so great a person, Beelzebub took Him from street to street and showed Him all his kingdoms,\n",
      "that he might, if possible, tempt the Prince to buy some of his vanities. But the Blessed One\n",
      "did not wish any of these vanities, and therefore left the town without spending so much as\n",
      "one farthing upon these vanities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now these pilgrims, Christian and Faithful, as I said, had to go through this fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, so they did, but behold, whenever they entered into the fair, it and the town itself\n",
      "were in a hubbub about them. For the pilgrims were clothed with raiment that was very different\n",
      "from the raiment of any that traded in that fair. The people gazed upon Christian and Faithful\n",
      "and called them outlandish men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then also, they wondered at the pilgrim's speech, as few could understand what they said, for\n",
      "they spoke the language of the Celestial City. But those that kept the fair spoke the language\n",
      "of the city of Vanity Fair, and they could not understand one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when these pilgrims would not buy their wares and would not even look at them, the sellers\n",
      "were angry and mocked these men, and some called on others to smite them. At last the master\n",
      "of the fair told his men to question the pilgrims. And when Christian and Faithful told the\n",
      "men that they were strangers in the world and were going to the Celestial City, the men thought\n",
      "they were mad. Therefore they took them and beat them and threw mud at them, and then they\n",
      "put them in a cage to be a show to the people at the fair. But when they were tired of mocking\n",
      "them, these two pilgrims were again examined and charged as guilty of the great disturbance\n",
      "in the fair. So they beat them pitilessly, and hanged irons upon them, and led them in chains\n",
      "up and down the fair. Then Christian and Faithful behaved so wisely and patiently, that the\n",
      "others were still more angry, and said they would put these men to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, after a trial, Faithful was brought out, to do with him according to their law.\n",
      "And first they scourged him, then they buffeted him, then they stoned him with stones, then\n",
      "they pricked him with their swords, and last of all they burned him to ashes at the stake.\n",
      "Now I saw behind the people a chariot and a couple of horses waiting for Faithful, who was\n",
      "taken by it through the clouds, the nearest way to the Celestial City. Then was Christian sent\n",
      "back to the prison, where he dwelt for a time, till he escaped and went again on his way. But\n",
      "he did not go alone, for there was one whose name was Hopeful, who left the town of Vanity,\n",
      "and was a companion to Christian in his pilgrimage. They went on their way till they came to\n",
      "a pleasant river. Now I beheld in my dream that they had not journeyed far, when the river\n",
      "and the way parted, and at this they were very sorry, yet they dare not go out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little before them was a meadow and a stile to go over into it. Then said Christian, \"If\n",
      "this meadow lies along by our path, let us go over.\" He went to the stile to see, and behold,\n",
      "a path lay alongside of the way, on the other side of the fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is as I wish,\" said Christian. \"Come, good Hopeful, and let us go over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Hopeful, \"what if this path should lead us out of the way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not likely,\" said the other. \"Look, it goes along by the wayside.\" So Hopeful, being\n",
      "persuaded by Christian, went after him over the stile. When they had gone over and had got\n",
      "into the path, they found it very easy for their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look,\" said Christian to Hopeful, \"did I not tell you so? You see, we are right after all.\"\n",
      "So they followed Vain-confidence, and he went before them. This pit was made by the Prince\n",
      "of those grounds on purpose, to catch such foolish men as Vain-confidence. He, then, fell into\n",
      "the pit and was dashed to pieces with his fall. But Christian was silent, for he began to be\n",
      "afraid that he had led Hopeful out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it began to rain and thunder and lighten in a very dreadful manner, and the river flowed\n",
      "over the banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Hopeful groaned, \"Oh that I had kept on my way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the waters were greatly risen, so that to go back was very dangerous. Yet they\n",
      "tried to go back, but it was so dark, and the flood was so high, that as they went they were\n",
      "nearly drowned nine or ten times, and they could not reach the stile again that night. Wherefore\n",
      "the giant, getting up early, and walking up and down in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful\n",
      "asleep. Then with a grim and surly voice he woke them, and asked them what they were doing\n",
      "in his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims and had lost their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The giant said, \"You have trampled on my ground, and slept on it, and therefore you must go\n",
      "along with me.\" So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than they. Also they said\n",
      "very little, for they knew they had done wrong. Now Giant Despair had a wife, and he told her\n",
      "he had taken a couple of men prisoners, because they were sleeping on his grounds. Then she\n",
      "told him that, when he arose in the morning, he should beat them without mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Giant Despair got a cudgel, and went down to the dungeon and beat Christian and Hopeful\n",
      "fearfully, so that they could not move. Then the giant left them, and they spent their time\n",
      "in sighs and bitter tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next night Giant Despair again talked to his wife, and she said, \"Tell your prisoners to\n",
      "kill themselves, for they will never escape from the dungeon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So when morning came, the giant went to them in a surly manner, and seeing they still ached\n",
      "with the stripes he had given them, he told them to poison themselves, for they would never\n",
      "get away from him in any other way. But they asked the giant to let them go. That made him\n",
      "so angry that he rushed on them and would have killed them, but he fell into a fit and lost\n",
      "for a time the use of his hand, wherefore he withdrew and left them as before. Well, towards\n",
      "evening the giant went down again to the dungeon to see if his prisoners had followed his advice\n",
      "and poisoned themselves. He found them alive, but because of their wounds and for want of bread\n",
      "and water they could do little but breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at night the giant's wife said: \"Take the prisoners into the castle yard to-morrow, and\n",
      "show them the bones and skulls of those prisoners you have already killed. Tell them that in\n",
      "a week you will tear them to pieces, as you have torn your other prisoners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the morning was come, the giant went to them again and took them into the castle yard,\n",
      "and showed them all his wife had bidden him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, about midnight, Christian and Hopeful began to pray, and they prayed till dawn of day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now just at dawn Christian spoke in sudden amazement. \"How foolish we are to lie here, when\n",
      "we might be free after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christian pulled it out and began to try the dungeon door, and the bolt, as he turned the key,\n",
      "yielded, and the door flew open, and Christian and Hopeful both came out. Then Christian and\n",
      "Hopeful went on till they came to the King's highway and so were safe, because they were out\n",
      "of the giant's grounds. Now when they had got over the stile, they began to wonder what they\n",
      "should do to keep other pilgrims from falling into the hands of Giant Despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many pilgrims, that came after, read what was written and escaped Giant Despair. They then\n",
      "went on till they came to the Delectable Mountains. These mountains belonged to the Lord of\n",
      "the steep hill which Christian had climbed. So they went up these mountains to behold the gardens\n",
      "and orchards, the vineyards and fountains. There, too, they drank and washed themselves and\n",
      "ate the fruit of the vineyards. Now there were Shepherds on the mountains, who welcomed them\n",
      "lovingly and showed them many wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These,\" said the Shepherds, \"are for an example to others to be careful not to clamber too\n",
      "high, or to come too near the brink of this mountain.\" The name of this mountain was Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Shepherds took them to the top of another mountain, and the name of it was Caution,\n",
      "and the Shepherds bid them look afar off. When the pilgrims did this, they saw, as they thought,\n",
      "several men walking up and down among the tombs that were there.\n",
      "\n",
      "They answered, \"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From that stile,\" said the Shepherds, \"there goes a path that leads straight to Doubting Castle,\n",
      "which is kept by Giant Despair. These men,\" and the Shepherds pointed to those among the tombs,\n",
      "\"came once on a pilgrimage as you do now. But when they came to the stile, because the right\n",
      "way was rough, they went over it into the meadow. Here they were taken by Giant Despair and\n",
      "cast into Doubting Castle. After they had been kept some time in the dungeon, he at last did\n",
      "put out their eyes. Then he led them among those tombs, and left them to wander there till\n",
      "this very day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Christian and Hopeful thought of their escape from Doubting Castle, and they looked at\n",
      "one another with tears in their eyes. But yet they said nothing to the Shepherds. Now I saw\n",
      "in my dream that the Shepherds brought them to another place, where was a door in the side\n",
      "of a hill, and they opened the door and bid the pilgrims look in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said Christian, \"What means this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shepherds said, \"This is a byway to hell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Shepherds said one to another, \"Let us show the pilgrims the gates of the Celestial\n",
      "City, if they have skill to look through our glass.\" Yet they thought they saw something like\n",
      "the gate, and also some of the beauty of the place. When they were about to depart, one of\n",
      "the Shepherds gave them a note of the way. So I awoke from my dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I slept and dreamed again, and I saw the same two pilgrims going down the mountains and\n",
      "along the highway. \"It is there I am going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they followed him in the path that had joined the way, and this path slowly turned, and\n",
      "at last turned them so far from the City that they wished to go to, that in a little time their\n",
      "faces were turned away from it. Yet they still followed him. Wherefore there they lay, crying\n",
      "some time, for they could not get themselves out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Shining One, \"It is a Flatterer that has clothed himself like an angel of light.\"\n",
      "So he rent the net and let the men out. And he said to the pilgrims, \"Follow me,\" and he led\n",
      "them back to the way which they had left when they followed the Flatterer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one with the whip then asked them where they slept last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said, \"With the Shepherds on the Delectable Mountains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked them if the Shepherds had not given them a note, telling them about the way. They\n",
      "answered, \"Yes,\" but they had forgotten to read it. He asked them also if the Shepherds did\n",
      "not tell them to beware of the Flatterer. They answered, \"Yes,\" but they did not think that\n",
      "this man who spoke so well could be he. Then I saw in my dream that the Shining One commanded\n",
      "them to lie down. And he took his whip, and when he had whipped them he said, \"As many as I\n",
      "love I rebuke and punish, be careful therefore and repent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This done, he bid them go on their way and take good heed to the other directions of the Shepherds.\n",
      "So they thanked the Shining One for all his kindness, and went gladly along the right way.\n",
      "Now I saw in my dream that when the pilgrims had got safely over the Enchanted Ground, they\n",
      "entered a beautiful country where the air was very sweet and pleasant. Every day they heard\n",
      "continually the singing of birds, and every day they saw the flowers appear in the earth. In\n",
      "this country the sun shineth night and day, and here they were within sight of the City to\n",
      "which they went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilgrims then, especially Christian, began to be afraid, and looked this way and that way,\n",
      "but could find no way by which to escape the river. Then they entered the river, and Christian\n",
      "began to sink and to cry out to his friend Hopeful, saying, \"I sink in deep waters, the billows\n",
      "go over my head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hopeful cheered Christian, and said he felt the ground under his feet. Yet a great horror\n",
      "and darkness fell upon Christian, for he thought he should never reach the Celestial City,\n",
      "and Hopeful had much difficulty to keep his friend's head above water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The City stood upon a mighty hill, but the pilgrims went up that with ease, talking gladly\n",
      "to their shining companions, and thus they came up to the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And over the gate there were written in letters of gold \"Blessed are they that do the King's\n",
      "Commandments and may enter in through the gates into the City.\" And I heard many voices saying,\n",
      "\"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And after that they shut up the gates, and when I had seen this, I wished I myself were within.\n",
      "Mr. Price was Susan's father. He rented a small farm and was always hard at work. No more honest\n",
      "man could be found far or near, and he loved his little daughter from the bottom of his big heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Price was Susan's mother. She was a good woman who was always busy cooking, or cleaning,\n",
      "or sewing. The bread and cakes made by her were better than those made by any one else in the\n",
      "village. When she was not doing household work, she earned money by taking in plain needlework.\n",
      "All who knew Mrs. Price liked her and were sorry she was so far from strong. That no girl had\n",
      "a better mother than Susan, every one agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "John and William were Susan's little brothers. They were quite sure that no other boys in all\n",

      "Our story begins on the evening before the first of May. Now one hundred years ago, Mayday\n",
      "was looked forward to with glee by all English children living in the country. Early that morning\n",
      "the lads and lasses of the village, gaily decked with flowers, would go merrily singing from\n",
      "house to house. In their midst would walk the Queen of the May, or sometimes, seated in a chair\n",
      "twined round with blossom, she would be carried from door to door by her little companions.\n",
      "With a wreath of their gayest flowers they would crown her their Queen, and for her would be\n",
      "woven the fairest garlands. After the May carols were sung, cake, coppers, or small coins would\n",
      "be given to the boys and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "To choose their Queen and to arrange their flowers the children would meet on the last day\n",
      "of April. This they did in the village where Susan lived, and their meeting-place was in a\n",
      "corner of a field close by a large pink hawthorn. A shady lane ran past one side of the bush.\n",
      "On another side a sweetbrier hedge separated it from the garden belonging to an attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "This attorney was a very cross man, so cross that the village people were always in fear of\n",
      "him. Although he had hedged and fenced his garden, it sometimes happened that there would stray\n",
      "into it a pig, or a dog, or a goat, or a goose belonging to a poor neighbor. Then the attorney\n",
      "would go to the owner of the stray animal and in a harsh voice demand money to pay for the\n",
      "damage it had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did this cruel man let people walk along the paths through his meadows, although they did\n",
      "no harm. He blocked up the stiles with stones and prickly shrubs, so that not even a gosling\n",
      "could squeeze under them nor a giant climb over. Even the village children were afraid to fly\n",
      "their kites near his fields, lest they should get entangled in his trees or fall on his ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Case was the name of this attorney, and he had one son and a daughter called Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "For long the father paid no attention to the education of his children, for all his time and\n",
      "thought were given to money-making. Meanwhile Barbara and her brother ran wild with the village\n",
      "children. But suddenly Mr. Case decided to send his son to a tutor to learn Latin, and to employ\n",
      "a maid to wait upon Barbara. At the same time he gave strict orders that his children should\n",
      "no longer play with their old companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village children were not at all sorry when they heard this. Barbara had not been a favorite\n",
      "among them, for she had always wanted to rule them and to secure for herself the chief part\n",
      "in their games. When Barbara saw that she was not missed by her old friends she was vexed,\n",
      "and she became angry when she found that they paid no attention to the grand air with which\n",
      "she now spoke nor to the fine frocks which she wore.\n",
      "\n",
      "To one girl Barbara had a special dislike. This was none other than Susan Price, the sweetest-tempered\n",
      "and busiest lass in the village, and the pride and delight of all who knew her. The farm rented\n",
      "by Susan's father was near the house in which Mr. Case lived, and Barbara from her window used\n",
      "to watch Susan at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the little girl was raking the garden-plots in her neat garden; sometimes she was\n",
      "weeding the paths; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees,\n",
      "and sometimes she was in the hen-yard scattering corn among the eager little chickens. In the\n",
      "evening Barbara often saw her sitting in the summer-house over which sweet honeysuckle crept,\n",
      "and there, with a clean three-legged pine table before her upon which to lay her work, Susan\n",
      "would sew busily. Her seams were even and neat, for Mrs. Price had taught her daughter that\n",
      "what is worth doing is worth doing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Susan and her mother were great favorites in the village. It was at Mrs. Price's door\n",
      "that the children began their Mayday rounds, and it was Susan who was usually Queen of the May.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now time for the village children to choose their queen. The setting sun was shining\n",
      "full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn when the merry group met to make their plans for\n",
      "the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara Case, sulkily walking alone in her father's garden, heard the happy voices and, crouching\n",
      "behind the hedge that divided her from the other children, she listened to their plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Susan?\" were the first words she overheard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, where is Susan?\" repeated a boy called Philip, stopping short in a tune he was playing\n",
      "on his pipe: \"I want her to sing me this air, I can't remember how it goes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I wish Susan would come, I'm sure,\" cried Mary, a little girl whose lap was full of primroses.\n",
      "I wish she would come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing can be done without Susan!\" cried another child. \"She always shows us where the nicest\n",
      "flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Susan must help to weave the garlands,\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Susan must be Queen of the May!\" shouted several together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why does she not come?\" grumbled Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose, who was Susan's special friend, now came forward to remind them that when Susan was late\n",
      "it was always because she was needed at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go, Rose, and tell her to make haste,\" cried the impatient Philip. He wants to rob us of our\n",
      "playground. I wish he and Bab, or Miss Barbara, as I suppose we must now call her, were a hundred\n",
      "miles away, I do. Just yesterday she knocked down my ninepins on purpose as she passed with\n",
      "her gown trailing in the dust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" cried Mary, \"her gown is always trailing. She does not hold it up nicely like Susan,\n",
      "and in spite of all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat. Mamma says she hopes I shall\n",
      "grow like Susan, and so do I. I should not like to be vain like Barbara were I ever so rich.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rich or poor,\" said Philip, \"it does not become a girl to be vain, much less bold, as Barbara\n",
      "was the other day. Then she pulled on her straw hat that had fallen back while she was looking\n",
      "up at the laburnum, and went her way home, and the gentleman said to me after she was gone,\n",
      "'Pray, who is that neat, modest girl?' But I wish,\" cried Philip, interrupting himself, \"I\n",
      "wish Susan would come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara, still crouching on the other side of the hedge, heard everything that was said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan was all this time, as her friend Rose had guessed, busy at home. She had tired herself\n",
      "with baking, and now, alarmed by her husband's strange conduct, she sat down pale and trembling.\n",
      "The father threw himself into a chair, folded his arms, and gazed into the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan was the first who ventured to break the silence. Fondling her father, she tried to coax\n",
      "him to eat the supper prepared for him. This, however, she could not persuade him to do, but\n",
      "he said, with a faint smile, that he thought he could eat one of her guinea-hen's eggs. Susan\n",
      "thanked him, and showed her eagerness to please her dear father by running as fast as she could\n",
      "to her neat chicken-yard. Alas! the guinea-fowl was not there. It had strayed into the garden\n",
      "of Mr. Case. She could see it through the paling. Going to the garden-gate, Susan timidly opened\n",
      "it, and seeing Miss Barbara walk slowly by, she asked if she might come in and take her guinea-fowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara, who at that moment was thinking of all she had heard the village children say, started\n",
      "when she heard Susan's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut the gate,\" she said crossly, \"you have no business in our garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only sixpence and you say that won't do,\" said Susan with a sigh, as she looked at\n",
      "her favorite which was in the maid's cruel hands, struggling and screaming in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan went away feeling very sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rose, however, learned that her friend's guinea-hen was kept a prisoner by Barbara, she\n",
      "was hot with indignation, and at once ran back to tell the story to her companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "BAD NEWS\n",
      "\n",
      "As Susan entered the cottage parlor, Farmer Price drew his chair close to his wife. \"You see\n",
      "there is something amiss with me,\" he said; \"I must tell you what it is.\" \"I am afraid I was\n",
      "cross when I came in to-night, but I had something to vex me, as you shall hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the farmer told how, a fortnight before, lots had been drawn in the nearest town, to see\n",
      "which men there and in the surrounding villages should leave home to be trained as soldiers.\n",
      "For a hundred years ago it was in this way that men were found to defend their country. Only\n",
      "if they were under eighteen or above forty years of age could they escape drawing lots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, as I would be forty in ten days,\" said the farmer, \"I was told just to call myself forty\n",
      "then and there; but the truth is the truth, and should be spoken at all times, come what may.\n",
      "And when the lots were drawn, it fell to me among others to leave home to be trained to fight.\n",
      "I was thinking how unhappy we should be to part, when I heard that if I paid nine guineas to\n",
      "another man, he would take my place, and I could remain at home with you. I had not the money,\n",
      "for you know the bad luck we had with the sheep this year, and how they died one after the\n",
      "other. But I went to Mr. Case and asked him to lend me the money. He said he would if I handed\n",
      "over to him my lease, for he said, 'If you do not repay me the guineas I shall keep the lease\n",
      "until you do.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was a fortnight ago, and to-night Attorney Case tells me he has discovered that, owing\n",
      "to some mistake in the lease, we may be turned out of the farm at any time. But I've not come\n",
      "to the worst part yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Farmer Price stopped short, and his wife and Susan gazed anxiously into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The truth must be told,\" he said with a deep sigh, \"I must now leave you in three days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must you?\" said his wife faintly. \"Susan dear, open the window.\" Susan ran to do as she was\n",
      "bid, and then returned to her mother's side. The fresh air soon revived the poor woman, and\n",
      "she begged her husband to go on with his story, and to hide nothing from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmer Price had no wish to hide anything from those he loved so well. He believed that the\n",
      "truth should be spoken at all times, but never had he found it so difficult as at this moment.\n",
      "What had happened was this. Attorney Case had met Farmer Price that evening. The farmer was\n",
      "coming home, whistling, from a new-plowed field. The Attorney was on horseback, and had just\n",
      "dined at the Abbey with Sir Arthur Somers. The Abbey had until lately belonged to Sir Arthur's\n",
      "elder brother, but now that he was dead, Sir Arthur owned the estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Case had looked after the property for the elder brother, and was anxious to be employed\n",
      "by Sir Arthur. There were many farms on the estate, and it had been part of the Attorney's\n",
      "work to look after the repairs and to collect the rents. Unfortunately, he had an unpleasant\n",
      "way of dealing with the farmers, ordering them as he had no right to do, and being harsh with\n",
      "those who, through misfortune, had not enough money to to pay their rent in full. As the Attorney\n",
      "met Farmer Price he stopped him, saying, \"A word with you, Farmer Price, if you please. Walk\n",
      "alongside my horse, and listen. You know the field with the pink hawthorn where the village\n",
      "children play? I am going to add it to my garden. I hear you say it does not belong to me.\n",
      "What do you mean by that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean what I say,\" said Price; \"the field is not yours.\" So angry was the Attorney on hearing\n",
      "this, that he at once made up his mind to hurt the farmer as much as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My good man,\" he said, \"you will remember that a fortnight ago I lent you nine guineas. To-morrow\n",
      "morning you must return them to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those guineas,\" replied the farmer, \"I paid, as you know, to the man who said he would go\n",
      "instead of me to be trained as a soldier. But he has not yet gone, and I can still get the\n",
      "guineas back from him and go myself to be trained.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney was not prepared for this answer. \"I do not want to drive you to that,\" he said,\n",
      "pretending to be kind. \"Now about the field--you do not want to add it to the farm, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not, for it is not mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why object to my having it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it is not yours. The children who play there have the right. It belongs to the village.\n",
      "Truth is truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a debt is a debt,\" shouted the angry Attorney, \"and must be paid. Bring me my nine guineas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a heavy heart Farmer Price walked on. He passed the door of his cottage and went in search\n",
      "of the man to whom he had paid the money. The man was quite willing to return it, as there\n",
      "were many others, he said, who would be willing to give him the same sum or more for his services.\n",
      "The moment Price got the money he took it straight to Mr. Case, laid it on his desk and was\n",
      "going away, when the Attorney called out, \"Not so fast, you have forgotten your lease.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah yes! my lease, I had forgotten it. Let me have it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" said the Attorney with a cruel smile, \"but I cannot let you have it. On reading\n",
      "it over I find that owing to a mistake you may be turned out of the farm at any time. I must\n",
      "keep it to show to Sir Arthur. I have no doubt he will want me to look after things for him\n",
      "as I did for his brother. Now perhaps you wish you had quietly let me add the field to my garden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmer Price said nothing, but dragged himself home a sad man.\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "SUSAN'S GUINEA-FOWL\n",
      "\n",
      "When Susan had heard her father's story, she quite forgot the loss of her guinea-hen, and thought\n",
      "only of her poor mother who, try as she might, could not bear the bad news. In the middle of\n",
      "the night Susan was roused, as Mrs. Price had become ill, and it was not until early morning\n",
      "that the poor woman fell asleep, her daughter's hand locked fast in hers. Susan remained sitting\n",
      "by the bedside, breathing quietly. Then seeing the candle burn low, she gently withdrew her\n",
      "hand, and on tiptoe went to put out the light, lest the unpleasant smell should wake her mother.\n",
      "All was silent. The gray light of dawn stole into the little room; the sun rose slowly, and\n",
      "Susan peered through the small panes of the lattice window at the glorious sight. A few birds\n",
      "began to chirp, and as the little girl listened to them, her mother started and spoke in her\n",
      "sleep. Susan quickly hung up a white apron before the window to keep out the light, and at\n",
      "the same moment she heard in the distance the voices of the village children singing their\n",
      "Mayday songs. Soon she could see them, Philip leading the way playing upon his pipe and tabor,\n",
      "the others following with nosegays and garlands in their hands. They were coming towards the\n",
      "cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Susan, \"but my mother is ill. I can't leave her, you know.\" Mrs. Price, when\n",
      "she awoke, felt much better, but slowly there came back to her memory the sad news she had\n",
      "heard the evening before. She asked herself if it could have been a dream, but no, it was all\n",
      "too true. She could recall her husband's look as he had said, \"I must leave you in three days.\"\n",
      "Then suddenly she roused herself. \"Why! he'll want, he'll want a hundred things,\" she said.\n",
      "\"I must get his linen ready for him. I'm afraid it's very late. Susan's loving help was never\n",
      "more wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better, thank you.\" Now we are a match for Miss Barbara. You won't like to leave home, so\n",
      "I'll go to her, and you shall see your guinea-hen in ten minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose hurried away, filled with joy at the thought that soon she would return to Susan with\n",
      "her lost bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Barbara's maid, Betty, was the first person she saw on reaching the Attorney's house.\n",
      "Rose said she must see Barbara and was shown into a parlor where the young lady sat reading a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you startled me! Is it only you?\" she said, looking up and seeing no one but the maid.\n",
      "Then, as she caught sight of Rose, she went on, \"You should have said I was not at home. Pray,\n",
      "my good girl, what do you want?\" she said, turning to Rose. \"Is it to borrow or to beg that\n",
      "you are here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The person from whom I come does not wish either to borrow or to beg, but to pay for what\n",
      "she asks,\" answered Rose. Then opening her well-filled purse, she held out to Barbara a bright\n",
      "shilling, saying, \"Now please be so good as to give me Susan's guinea-hen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may keep your shilling,\" replied Barbara. \"It would have been enough if it had been paid\n",
      "yesterday when I asked for it, but I told Susan that as it was not paid then I should keep\n",
      "the hen, and I shall. You may go back and tell her so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Barbara spoke she had been looking into the open purse in Rose's hand. She thought she\n",
      "could count at least ten shillings. Could she not manage to get at least five of them for the\n",
      "guinea-hen, she wondered?\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose little guessed what was going on in Barbara's mind, and exclaimed angrily, \"We must have\n",
      "Susan's favorite hen, whatever it costs. If one shilling won't do, take two. If two won't do,\n",
      "take three,\" and she flung the coins one after the other on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three won't do,\" said Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then take four.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fifth shilling was offered, but Barbara, seeing that she had the game in her own hands, was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Rose threw down shilling after shilling, till twelve bright pieces lay on the table, and\n",
      "her purse was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now you may take the guinea-hen,\" said Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose pushed the money towards the greedy girl, but at the same moment remembered that it had\n",
      "not belonged to herself alone. At once she seized the silver coins, and saying that she must\n",
      "first see if the friends with whom she shared them were willing to part with them, she ran off.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the children heard Rose's story, they were amazed, that even Barbara could be so mean,\n",
      "but they all agreed that at any cost the guinea-fowl must be set free. In a body they went\n",
      "to Susan and told her so, at the same time handing her the purse. Then they ran off without\n",
      "waiting to be thanked. Rose only stayed behind. Susan knew that she must accept the present\n",
      "gladly, just as she would give one gladly. She was much touched by the kindness of her friends,\n",
      "but she took the purse as simply as she would have given it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This, to be sure, will go but a little way,\" thought Susan; \"but still it may be of some use.\"\n",
      "I assure you I am clever with my needle now--try me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan told her friend that she would most gladly accept her help, but that she had finished\n",
      "all the needlework that was wanted at present. Mrs. Price's last baking had failed for want\n",
      "of good yeast. She was not now strong enough to attempt another herself, and when the brewer's\n",
      "boy came to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast, she thanked him, but sighed and said\n",
      "she feared it would be of little use to her. She thinks no more of her being handsome than\n",
      "I do myself; yet she has as proper a respect for herself, ma'am, as you have; and I always\n",
      "see her neat, and she is always with her mother, or fit people, as a girl should be. As for\n",
      "her mother, she dotes upon her, as well she may; for I should myself if I had half such a daughter,\n",
      "ma'am; and then she has two little brothers, and she's as good to them and, my boy Philip says,\n",
      "taught them to read more than the school-mistress did; but I beg your pardon, ma'am, I cannot\n",
      "stop myself when I once begin to talk of Susan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have really said enough to make me wish to see her,\" said her mistress. \"Pray send for\n",
      "her now; we can see her before we go out to walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind housekeeper gladly sent off her boy Philip for Susan, who was never so untidy that\n",
      "she could not come at once when sent for. She had been very busy, but orderly people can be\n",
      "busy and neat at the same time. Putting on her usual straw hat, she set out for the Abbey.\n",
      "On the way she overtook Rose's mother, who was going there too with a basket of fresh muslin.\n",
      "When Susan reached the Abbey, her simple dress and manners and the good sense with which she\n",
      "answered the questions put to her, pleased the ladies greatly. They saw that the housekeeper\n",
      "had not spoken too highly of the farmer's daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two ladies were the sisters of Sir Arthur Somers. They were kind and wise; kind in wishing\n",
      "to spread happiness among their poor neighbors, and wise in wishing these people to be happy\n",
      "in their own way. They did not wish to manage them, but only to help them. As Sir Arthur was\n",
      "always willing to aid his sisters, it seemed as if they would prove a blessing in in the village\n",
      "near which they had come to live. When Susan took leave of the ladies, she was told they would\n",
      "call at her home that evening at six o'clock. Such a grand event as Susan's visit to the Abbey\n",
      "soon became known to Barbara Case and her maid, and together they watched for her return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There she is! She has just gone into her garden,\" cried Bab; \"we'll run in at once and hear\n",

      "Susan was gathering some marigolds and parsley for her mother's soup. \"Well, Susan, and how\n",
      "are things going with you to-day?\" asked Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My mother is rather better, she says; thank you, ma'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Ma'am, how polite we have grown all of a sudden!\" said Bab, winking at her maid. \"One can\n",
      "see you have been in good company. Come, tell us all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you see the ladies themselves,\" asked Betty, \"or only the housekeeper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What room were you in?\" went on Bab. \"Did you see Miss Somers or Sir Arthur?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Somers,\" replied Susan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Betty, she saw Miss Somers! I must hear about it. Susan, stop gathering those things, and\n",

      "\"I can't indeed, Miss Barbara, for my mother wants her soup, and I am in a hurry.\" And Susan\n",
      "ran home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you believe it, her head is full of soup now?\" said Bab to her maid. \"She seems to think\n",
      "nothing of her visit to the Abbey. My papa may well call her Simple Susan. But simple or not\n",
      "I mean to get what I want out of her. Maybe when she has settled the grand matter of the soup,\n",
      "she'll be able to speak. I'll step in and ask to see her mother. That will put her in a good\n",
      "humor in a trice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara went to the cottage and found Susan standing over a pot on the fire. \"Is the soup ready?\"\n",
      "she asked. \"I'll wait till you take it in to your mother and go in with you. I want to ask\n",
      "her how she is, myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down then, miss,\" said Susan, \"I have put in the parsley, so the soup is nearly ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara sat down and plied Susan with questions. How was Miss Somers dressed? Were the sisters\n",
      "dressed alike? What were they having for dinner at the Abbey? Above all, what could Miss Somers\n",
      "mean by saying she would call at Farmer Price's cottage at six o'clock that evening? \"What\n",
      "do you think she could mean?\" asked Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What she said,\" replied Susan, \"that she would be here at six o'clock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's plain enough,\" said Barbara, \"but what else do you think she meant? People, you know,\n",
      "often mean more or less than they say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do,\" answered Susan, with a smile that made Barbara guess of whom she was thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bab did not mean Susan to know that she guessed, so she said, \"I suppose you think that\n",
      "Miss Somers meant more than she said?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was not thinking of Miss Somers when I said what I did,\" replied Susan.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause, and then Bab remarked, \"How nice the soup looks!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan had poured it into a basin, and as she dropped over it the bright yellow marigold, it\n",
      "looked very tempting. She tasted it and added a little salt; tasted it again, and added a little\n",
      "more. Then she thought it was just as her mother liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I must taste it!\" said Bab, seizing the basin greedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you take a spoon?\" said Susan, trembling as she saw the big mouthfuls Barbara took with\n",
      "a loud noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take a spoon, indeed!\" exclaimed Bab. \"How dare you, how dare you speak so to me? 'Take a\n",
      "spoon, pig!' was what you meant to say! I'll never enter your cottage again!\" And she flounced\n",
      "out of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan stood still, amazed at the beginning of Barbara's speech, but her last words explained\n",
      "the sudden outburst. Susan, as she grew up, forgot the childish saying, but Barbara remembered\n",
      "it, and it was this that she thought was in Susan's mind when she asked her to take a spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, miss,\" said Betty, when she found Barbara in a passion upon her return from the cottage,\n",
      "\"indeed I wonder you set your foot within the door. Your own papa has been at the Abbey all\n",
      "morning, and you can hear all you wish to know from him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara at once ran to her father's parlor, but saw at a glance that he was in no mood to answer\n",
      "questions. Instead of leaving him alone, she did all in her power to find out why he had been\n",
      "at the Abbey, and what he had seen and heard there. And when she found that her father would\n",
      "tell her nothing, she ran back to her maid, saying, \"Papa is so cross! I cannot put up with him.\"\n",

      "It is true that Attorney Case was not in a happy mood. His visit to the Abbey had made him\n",
      "feel sure that Sir Arthur and he would not agree about the treatment of the farmers who lived\n",
      "on the estate. One matter they had talked about was Sir Arthur's wish to enlarge his grounds\n",
      "and make a drive round them. A map of the estate lay upon the table and they looked at it together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! but I see this new road for the drive would run through Farmer Price's garden,\" said Sir\n",
      "Arthur. \"That would never do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It need not trouble you,\" said Attorney Case, \"you may do as you like with Price's land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How so?\" asked Sir Arthur. \"His lease will not be out for ten years, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, that would have been the case had there not been a mistake in it. I have the lease and\n",
      "can show you.\" The heartless man then went on to explain to Sir Arthur what the mistake was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Arthur remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I see,\" said the Attorney. \"You do not wish to annoy Farmer Price. But just put the matter\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You seem to forget that to take the farm out of this poor man's hands would be to ruin him,\"\n",
      "replied Sir Arthur, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" said the wicked Attorney, \"indeed I should be sorry for that, if it were not that\n",
      "Farmer Price is such an unruly, stubborn man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An unruly man, is he? If that be so, the sooner he leaves the place the better. When you go\n",
      "home, you will be good enough to send me the lease that I may, for myself, see the mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Case got up to go. But before he went, he thought he must try to find out if Sir Arthur\n",
      "was going to employ him to look after the estate, that is, if he was to be the agent. \"I will\n",
      "not trouble you about this lease, Sir Arthur,\" he said, \"but will hand it to your agent, if\n",
      "you will inform me who is to have that post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean to be my own agent,\" answered Sir Arthur, \"and will myself look after the happiness\n",
      "of the people among whom I have come to live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the surprise of this reply that had sent Attorney Case home so cross that Barbara had\n",
      "said to Betty she could not put up with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When his daughter had left him atone, the Attorney walked up and down the room deep in thought.\n",
      "\"At any rate,\" he said to himself at last, \"if Sir Arthur means to manage the estate himself\n",
      "in summer, he at least will need an agent in winter. I must try to get the post.\" And he still\n",
      "walked up and down, trying to think of some plan by which he would find favor at the Abbey.\n",
      "Now that morning he had heard the housekeeper at the Abbey ask the servants if any lamb were\n",
      "to be had in the village, as Sir Arthur would like to have it one day soon for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that he himself treated those farmers best who from time to time gave him presents,\n",
      "Attorney Case thought that if he sent a gift to Sir Arthur, it might help him to get what he\n",
      "wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the idea struck him than the Attorney went to the kitchen. Standing at the door\n",
      "was a shepherd-boy. Barbara, too, was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know of a nice fat lamb?\" the Attorney asked the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the shepherd-boy could answer, Barbara exclaimed, \"I know of one. Susan Price has a\n",
      "pet lamb that is as fat as fat can be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At once Attorney Case walked over to Farmer Price's cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if you could help it, Susan?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan clasped her hands in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can help it, Susan.\" She started up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More silly you,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She feeds out of my hand, she follows me about; I have always taken care of her; my mother\n",
      "gave her to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not forget it,\" said Susan, steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon, however, as the cruel man turned his back and left the house, Susan sat down, and\n",
      "hid her face in her hands. She was soon roused by the sound of her mother's feeble voice calling\n",
      "her from the inner room where she lay. Susan went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you there, love? \"How do you know? Who told you so? Tell me all quick!\" The next moment\n",
      "she was called out of the room, for a messenger had come from the Abbey for the bread-bill.\n",
      "Susan always made out the bills, for although she had not had many writing-lessons, she had\n",
      "taken great pains to learn, and wrote in a neat, clear hand. It is true she was in no mood\n",
      "to write or add now, but the work must be done. Having carefully ruled lines for the pounds,\n",
      "shillings and pence, she made out the bill and gave it to the boy who waited for it. Then she\n",
      "said to herself she would make out the other bills, for many of the people in the village had\n",
      "bought a few loaves and rolls of her making. \"And when these are done, I may go down to the\n",
      "meadow to take leave of my poor lamb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Susan could not find her slate, and when she did find it many of the figures were blurred,\n",
      "for Barbara had sat upon it. And then the numbers seemed to dance before her, and each time\n",
      "that she added, the answer was different. She went over and over the sums until her head ached.\n",
      "The table was covered with little square bits of paper on which she had written the bills when\n",
      "her father came in, holding in his hand an account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at this, Susan!\" he said, handing it to her. \"How could you be so careless, child? What\n",
      "have you been thinking about to let a bill like that go to the Abbey? Luckily, I met the messenger\n",
      "and asked to see how much it was. Look at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan looked and blushed. Instead of \"loaves\" she had written \"lambs.\" She altered the mistake\n",
      "and handed the bill to her father. He, meantime, was looking at the papers lying on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are all these, child?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of them were wrong, and I wrote them out again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of them! All of them as far as I can see,\" said her father rather angrily, pointing to\n",
      "the papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan read the bills. Most of them were for lambs instead of for loaves or rolls. Her thoughts\n",
      "had indeed been running upon the pet she was to part with so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she wrote the bills, and her father, who was struck by the patient way she set to\n",
      "work, said he would himself collect the money. He would be proud to be able to say to the neighbors\n",
      "that it was all earned by his own little daughter. Susan heard him sigh as he passed the knapsack\n",
      "she had packed for him, but she thought she would keep the pleasure of telling him of his week's\n",
      "leave until he came home. He had said he would have supper in her mother's room. She would\n",
      "tell the good news then. \"How delighted he will be when he hears,\" she said to herself, \"but\n",
      "I know he will be sorry too for poor Daisy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan thought she would now have time to run down to the meadow by the river-side to see her\n",
      "favorite, but just as she had tied on her straw hat the clock struck four. This was the hour\n",
      "at which she always went to fetch her brothers from the school near the village. So, as she\n",
      "knew that the little boys would be sorry if she were late, she put off her visit to the lamb\n",
      "and went at once to meet them.\n",

      "THE BLIND HARPER\n",
      "\n",
      "The dame-school, which was about a mile from the village, was a long, low house with a thatched\n",
      "roof. It was sheltered by a few old oaks, under which the grandparents and great-grandparents\n",
      "of the children now at school had played long ago. The play-green sloped down from the front\n",
      "of the school, and was enclosed by a rough paling. The children obeyed and loved the dame who\n",
      "taught them, for she was ever quick to praise them when they did well, and to give them all\n",
      "the pleasure she could. Susan had been taught by her, and the dame often told her little pupils\n",
      "that they must try to be like her, wise and modest, gentle and kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan always liked to hear of all that made others happy, but she had to tell the children\n",
      "that if they all spoke at once she would not be able to hear what any of them said. The children\n",
      "at once became silent, and looked round to see whence the sound came. Susan pointed to the\n",
      "great oak-tree, and they saw, sitting under its shade, an old man playing upon his harp. The\n",
      "children all drew near quietly, for the music was solemn; but as the harper heard little footsteps\n",
      "coming towards him, he played one of his more lively tunes. The merry troop pressed nearer\n",
      "and nearer to the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was said while the harper tuned his harp. When he once more began to play, not a word\n",
      "was spoken, but every now and again there was a cry of delight. The old man then let the children\n",
      "name the airs they would like best to hear. Each, time Susan spoke, he turned his face quickly\n",
      "to where she stood, and played the tune she asked for over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am blind,\" he said, \"and cannot see your faces, but I can tell something about each of you\n",
      "by your voices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you indeed?\" cried Susan's little brother William, who was now standing between the old\n",
      "man's knees. \"It was my sister Susan who spoke last. Can you tell us something about her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I can, I think,\" said the harper, lifting the little boy on his knee. \"Your sister Susan\n",
      "is good-natured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "William clapped his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And good-tempered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right,\" said little William, clapping louder than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said William, \"it's all true; but how did you find out she was fond of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is such a hard question,\" said the harper, \"that I must take time to think.\" \"Play 'Bumper\n",
      "Squire Jones.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man, though he did not seem quite pleased with the way in which he was asked, played\n",
      "\"Bumper Squire Jones.\" Several tunes were afterwards named by the same rough voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little children shrunk back shyly, as they looked at the bold boy. He was the son of Attorney\n",
      "Case, and as his father had not cured his temper when he was a child, it became worse and worse\n",
      "as he grew up. All who were younger and weaker than himself were afraid of him and disliked\n",
      "him. When the old harper was so tired that he could play no more, a lad who usually carried\n",
      "his harp for him came up, and held his master's hat to those around, saying, \"Will you please\n",
      "remember us?\" The children readily gave their halfpence to this poor, good-natured man, who\n",
      "had taken so much pains to amuse them. It pleased them better even than to give them to the\n",
      "gingerbread-woman, whose stall they loved to visit. The hat was held to the Attorney's son\n",
      "before he chose to see it. At last he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a shilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid, then, you'll get no other,\" said young Case, with a rude laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It never will do, sir, look at it yourself; the edges are all yellow. You can see the copper\n",
      "through it quite plain. Sir, nobody will take it from us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have nothing to do with that,\" said the rude boy, pushing away his hand. \"You may pass it,\n",
      "you know, as well as I do, if you look sharp. You have taken it from me, and I shan't take\n",
      "it back again, I can tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A whisper of \"that's very unjust,\" was heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who says it's unjust?\" cried the Attorney's son sternly, looking down upon his judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a quiet, timid boy, and young Case fancied that he would be afraid to say what he thought.\n",
      "However, after turning the shilling round several times, the butcher's lad said that so far\n",
      "as he could tell, although he would not like to be quite sure of it, the coin was not a good\n",
      "one. Then, seeing the Attorney's son scowl angrily at him, he turned to Susan saying that she\n",
      "knew more than he did about money, as so much passed through her hands in payment of the bread\n",
      "she made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll leave it to her,\" said the old harper. \"If she says the shilling is good, we will keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The coin was then handed to Susan, who had not yet spoken, but now that she was called upon\n",
      "she did not shrink from telling the truth. In a gentle but firm tone she said, \"I think the\n",
      "shilling is a bad one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's another then,\" cried the Attorney's son; \"I have plenty of shillings and sixpences.\n",
      "They are nothing to me.\" And he walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children now all started for their homes, and the old harper begged that Susan would show\n",
      "him the way to the village, if she were going there. The lad took up the harp and little William\n",
      "led the old man by the hand, while John ran on before to gather buttercups in the meadows.\n",
      "When they reached a little brook which they must cross by a narrow plank, Susan was afraid\n",
      "to leave the harper to the care of his little guide, so she herself took his hand and led him\n",
      "safely to the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they reached the road, and Susan told the boy who carried his master's harp that he could\n",
      "not now lose his way. She then said good-by to the harper, adding that she and her brothers\n",
      "must take the short path across the fields, which would not be so pleasant for him because\n",
      "of the stiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid Miss Somers will be waiting,\" said Susan to to her brothers as they ran along\n",
      "together. \"You know she said she would call at six o'clock, and I am sure by the length of\n",
      "our shadows that it is getting late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" went on John, \"she would not refuse to let us hear a blind man play on the harp.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies left the cottage, they took Susan with them through the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fancy we shall find what we want here,\" said Miss Somers, stopping before a shop-window\n",
      "where ribbons of all colors were displayed, and where lace collars, glass buttons and sheets\n",
      "of pins were laid out in order. They went in, and on the shelves behind the counter saw gay,\n",
      "neat linens and calicoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Susan, choose yourself a gown,\" said Miss Somers. \"Because you are a busy girl and behave\n",
      "well, we wish others to see that such is the conduct we approve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The shopkeeper was the father of Susan's friend, Rose. He stretched his arm to the highest\n",
      "shelf, then dived into drawers beneath the counter, sparing no pains to show the best goods\n",
      "to his customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan did not show the interest that might have been expected. But Susan felt that this was\n",
      "a great deal of money to spend upon a frock for herself, and yet she did not know how to ask\n",
      "if she might keep it for a better purpose. Although Susan said nothing, Miss Somers read in\n",
      "her face that she was perplexed. \"She does not like any of these things,\" whispered the lady\n",
      "to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She seems to be thinking of something else,\" was the low reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you do not fancy any of these calicoes,\" said the shopkeeper to Susan, \"we shall have a\n",
      "larger choice soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" answered Susan, with a smile, and a blush, \"these are all too good for me, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what, Susan?\" asked Miss Somers. \"Tell us what is passing in your little mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well then, it does not matter. You do not know us very well yet. When you do, you will not,\n",
      "I am sure, be afraid to be frank. Put the guinea in your pocket and make what use of it you\n",
      "please. From what we know and from what we have heard of you, we are sure you will make a good\n",
      "use of it.\" Good night, Susan, we shall soon come again to your neat cottage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan courtesied and looked gratefully at the ladies, but did not speak. She wished to say,\n",
      "\"I cannot explain to you here, with people around, what I want to do with my guinea, but when\n",
      "you come to our cottage you shall know all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After Susan had left, Miss Somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper who was folding up all\n",
      "the goods he had opened. \"You have had a great deal of trouble,\" she said, \"and as Susan will\n",
      "not choose a gown for herself, I must find one for her,\" and she chose the prettiest.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the man rolled up the parcel, Miss Somers asked him many questions about Susan, and he\n",
      "was only too glad to be able to tell what he knew about the good girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No later than last May morning,\" he said, \"Susan acted as it will please you to hear. She\n",
      "was to have been Queen of the May, which among the children in our village is a thing a good\n",
      "deal thought of. But Susan's mother was ill, and Susan, after being up with her all night,\n",
      "would not go out in the morning, even when they brought the crown to her. She put it upon my\n",
      "daughter Rose's head with her own hands, and to be sure Rose loves her as well as if she were\n",
      "her own sister. If I praise Susan it is not that I am any relation of the Prices, but just\n",
      "that I wish her well, as does every one that knows her. I'll send the parcel up to the Abbey,\n",
      "shall I, ma'am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" said Miss Somers, \"and as soon as your new goods come in, let us know. You\n",
      "will, I hope, find us good customers and well-wishers,\" she added, with a smile, \"for those\n",
      "who wish others well surely deserve to have well-wishers themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But to return to Susan. When she left the shop she carefully put the bright guinea into the\n",
      "purse with the twelve shillings her little friends had given her on Mayday. She next added,\n",
      "as far as she could remember them, the bills for bread that were owing to her, and found they\n",
      "came to about thirty-eight shillings. Then she hoped that by some means or other she might,\n",
      "during the week her father was to remain at home, make up the nine guineas that would enable\n",
      "him to stay with them altogether. \"If that could but be,\" she said to herself, \"how happy it\n",
      "would make my mother! She wanted to go there alone and take leave of her lamb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yours!\" cried the children with terror; \"and will you kill it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, that is what the butcher will do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little boys now burst into loud cries. The boy remembered Susan's firmness about the shilling,\n",
      "for it had saved him a beating. He went at once to his father to beg him to spare the lamb.\n",
      "But I've a plan in my head and I'm going straightway to Attorney Case. But he's a hard man,\n",
      "so we'll say nothing to the boys, lest nothing comes of it. Come, lads,\" he went on, turning\n",
      "to the crowd of children, \"it is time you were going your ways home. Turn the lamb in here,\n",
      "John, into the paddock for the night.\" The butcher then went to the Attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's a good, fat, tender lamb you want for Sir Arthur,\" he said, \"I could let you have\n",
      "one as good or better than Susan's and fit to eat to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Case wished to give the present to Sir Arthur as soon as he could, he said he would\n",
      "not wait for Susan's lamb, but would take the one offered by the butcher. Rose was at Farmer\n",
      "Price's cottage that evening, and was to have the pleasure of hearing Susan tell her father\n",
      "the good news that he might stay at home for one week longer. Mrs. Price was feeling better\n",
      "and said that she would sit up to supper in her wicker armchair. As Susan began to get ready\n",
      "the meal, little William, who was standing at the house-door watching for his father's return,\n",
      "called out suddenly, \"Susan, why here is our old man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the blind harper, \"I have found my way to you. \"Many roofs that are twice as high\n",
      "do not shelter folk so kind,\" he said. It was some little time before he could believe that\n",
      "what he heard was true; but the smiles of his wife, the noisy joy of his little boys, and the\n",
      "delight that shone in Susan's face at last convinced him that he was not in a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How, I can't make out, except by the baking,\" said her proud mother. \"Hey, Susan, is this\n",
      "your first baking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan did not like to tell the story of her guinea-hen, of the gown, and of her poor lamb.\n",
      "Part of this would seem as if she were speaking of her own good deeds, and part of it she did\n",
      "not like to remember.\n",

      "BARBARA VISITS THE ABBEY\n",
      "\n",
      "The old blind man had come from the mountains of Wales to try to gain a prize of ten guineas.\n",
      "This prize was to be awarded to the harper who should play the best at a large town about five\n",
      "miles from the village where Susan lived. In the evening, after the prize-giving was over,\n",
      "there was to be a ball in the town, so the events of the day were looked forward to by many\n",
      "around. Barbara was one of those who grew more and more excited as the time for the prize-giving\n",
      "and ball drew near. She longed to be asked to go there by some of the rich neighbors who could\n",
      "drive her in their carriage. So how pleased she was when, on the evening that her father and\n",
      "the butcher were talking about Susan's lamb, a servant in livery from the Abbey left a note\n",
      "for Mr. and Miss Barbara Case! It was to invite them to dinner and tea at the Abbey next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now they will find out,\" cried Bab, \"that I am indeed a genteel person, and they will wish\n",
      "to take me to the ball. At any rate, I shall do my best to be asked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Betty, \"a lady who would visit Susan Price might well be glad to take you\n",
      "in her carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then pray, Betty, do not forget to send to town first thing to-morrow for my new bonnet. Without\n",
      "that the ladies of the Abbey will think nothing of me. And I must coax Papa to buy me a new\n",
      "gown for the ball. I shall look well at all the ladies' dresses at the Abbey to-morrow and\n",
      "find out the fashion. And Betty, I have thought of a charming present to take Miss Somers.\n",
      "I shall give her Susan's guinea-hen. It's of no use to me, so carry it up early in the morning\n",
      "to the Abbey, with my compliments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling quite sure that her bonnet and the guinea-fowl would make Miss Somers think well of\n",
      "her, Barbara paid her first visit to the Abbey. She expected to see wonders, but when she was\n",
      "shown into the room where Miss Somers and other ladies were sitting, simply dressed, and with\n",
      "work, books and drawings on the table before them, she was surprised and vexed. There was nothing\n",
      "grand to be seen anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Miss Somers tried to find out what would interest her, and talked of walks, and flowers\n",
      "and gardens, Miss Barbara was offended. \"I will show them,\" she said to herself, \"that I can\n",
      "talk of other things.\" So in a grand tone she spoke of what she did not understand, until her\n",
      "mistaken airs of gentility made the ladies of the Abbey feel first amused and then ashamed.\n",
      "One by one the ladies left the room, and when Miss Somers went to change her dress for dinner,\n",
      "Barbara was left alone with some pretty drawings to amuse her. But the silly girl paid no heed\n",
      "to these. She could think only of the ball. Suddenly she remembered that nothing had been said\n",
      "about the guinea-hen. The truth was that Betty, in the hurry of dressing Barbara for her visit\n",
      "to the Abbey, had forgotten the bird, but it arrived just as Miss Somers was dressing. The\n",
      "housekeeper went to her mistress's room to say it had come. The woman came close up to the\n",
      "dressing-table, and said, \"I never like to speak till I'm sure, ma'am, and I'm not quite sure\n",
      "in this case, ma'am, but still I think it right to tell you what crossed my mind about this\n",
      "same guinea-hen, ma'am, and you can ask about it or do as you feel best, ma'am. Some time ago\n",
      "we had guinea-fowls of our own, and not knowing they were going to die as they have done, ma'am,\n",
      "I made bold to give a couple last Christmas to Susan Price, and very proud of them she was,\n",
      "ma'am, and I'm sure would never have parted with the hen of her own will. But if my eyes don't\n",
      "deceive me, ma'am, this guinea-hen that Miss Barbara sends to you with her compliments is the\n",
      "same that I gave to Susan. How Miss Barbara came by it, I can't tell, ma'am, but if my boy\n",
      "Philip was at home, he might know, for he's often at Farmer Price's cottage. If you wish it,\n",
      "ma'am, I'll ask him when he comes home to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think the best way will be for me to ask Miss Case herself about it this evening,\" said\n",
      "Miss Somers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other things talked of at table was a carving-knife that Sir Arthur had made for his\n",
      "sister. From this the conversation passed to carving. \"Now is my chance to find out about my\n",
      "present,\" thought the Attorney. \"Pray, may I ask,\" he said to Sir Arthur, \"how you carve a\n",
      "fore quarter of lamb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Arthur at once saw what the Attorney wanted to hear. Having answered his question, he went\n",
      "on to thank him for the present he had offered, but added, \"I am sorry I cannot accept it,\n",
      "as it is my rule never to accept gifts from my neighbors. The reason is that our poor tenants\n",
      "cannot show their good will in this way, as they have little or nothing to offer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Case listened with surprise. He was annoyed and angry, for he did not understand Sir\n",
      "Arthur's just mind and kind heart. After the ladies left the dining-room and were walking up\n",
      "and down the large hall, one of them remarked that it would be a charming place for music.\n",
      "Barbara, who like her father always seized any chance of turning the conversation as best pleased\n",
      "herself, said what a fine instrument was the harp. Then she spoke of the prize-giving to the\n",
      "harpers and of the ball that was to follow. \"I know a good deal about the ball,\" she said,\n",
      "\"because a lady in the town where it is to be held offered to take me with her, but although\n",
      "she has a carriage, Papa did not like to let her send it so far.\" At this point Barbara fixed\n",
      "her eyes on Miss Somers, that she might, if possible, read her thoughts, but as the lady was\n",
      "at that moment letting down the veil of her hat, her face was not seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we go for a little walk before tea?\" said Miss Somers to the other ladies. \"I have a\n",
      "pretty guinea-hen to show you.\" Barbara now felt hopeful, and when even among the pheasants\n",
      "and peacocks the guinea-hen was much admired, she was sure that Miss Somers must indeed be\n",
      "proud to accept her gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Philip came running by on an errand for his mother. As his eye fell upon the\n",
      "guinea-hen, he exclaimed before he knew, \"Why, that is Susan's guinea-hen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter, Philip?\" asked Miss Somers in a soothing voice, but Philip was not in\n",
      "the mood to be soothed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, ma'am, may I speak out?\" he asked, and without waiting for leave he gave a full account\n",
      "of the loss of Susan's guinea-fowl, of Rose's visit to Barbara, and of Barbara's greedy and\n",
      "cruel conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara denied all that Philip said, and told quite another tale. When she could find no more\n",
      "to say she blushed deeply, for she saw that her story was not believed. One might have thought\n",
      "she was covered with shame, had it not been that the moment Philip was out of sight, she exclaimed,\n",
      "\"I am sure I wish I had never seen this wretched guinea-hen! It is all Susan's fault for letting\n",
      "it stray into our garden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara was too angry to notice that she was admitting the truth of Philip's story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Somers, \"Susan will be more careful now that she has had so hard a lesson.\n",
      "Shall we see? Philip will, I am sure, carry the guinea-hen back to her, if we wish it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please, ma'am,\" said Barbara sulkily.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the guinea-hen was given to Philip, who set off with joy and was soon in sight of Farmer\n",
      "Price's cottage.\n",

      "A SURPRISE FOR SUSAN\n",

      "When Philip came to the door he stopped suddenly, for the idea struck him that it would give\n",
      "Rose great pleasure to carry the guinea-fowl to Susan. So he ran into the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they passed the butcher's house, his boy came out. They told him where they were going.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me come with you, let me come with you,\" he said. \"But wait one moment, for my father\n",
      "has something to say to you,\" and he darted into the house. The children waited. In a few moments\n",
      "they heard the bleating of a lamb, and soon they saw it being gently led by the butcher from\n",
      "the paddock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Daisy!\" exclaimed Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Daisy!\" they all shouted with joy, \"Susan's lamb! Susan's lamb!\" It's true the lamb\n",
      "did not know what was before it, but poor Susan did, and to wring her gentle heart was what\n",
      "I call cruel. But at any rate, here it is, safe and sound now. I'd have taken it to her sooner,\n",
      "but was off early this morning to the fair, and am but just come back. Daisy, though, was as\n",
      "well off in my paddock as in the field by the water-side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The troop of happy children went on their way with the guinea-fowl and the lamb. As they passed\n",
      "the shop where Susan had been shown the pretty calicoes, the shopkeeper, who, you remember,\n",
      "was Rose's father, came out. When he saw the lamb, and learned whose it was and heard its story,\n",
      "he gave the children some pieces of colored ribbon, with which Rose decorated Susan's favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children now once more moved on, led by Philip, who played joyfully upon his pipe and tabor.\n",
      "\"Now, if my father was not to go away from us next week, and if my mother were quite strong,\n",
      "I should be the happiest person in the world.\" As Susan finished speaking, a voice behind the\n",
      "listening crowd cried, in a rough tone, \"Let us pass, if you please; you have no right to block\n",
      "the road.\" Even her new bonnet, in which she had expected to be so much admired, now only served\n",
      "to hide her blushing face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I either, I hope,\" said Susan, looking round upon her companions with a most loving smile:\n",
      "\"I hope, while I live, I shall never forget your goodness to me last Mayday. Now that I've\n",
      "my pretty guinea-hen safe once more, I should think of returning your money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! no! no!\" was the cry, \"we don't want the money--keep it--keep it--you want it for your\n",
      "father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Susan, \"I am not too proud to accept it. I will keep your money for my father.\n",
      "Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Philip, \"don't let us talk of earning; don't let her talk to us of money now; she\n",
      "hasn't had time hardly to look at poor Daisy and her guinea-hen. Come, we had better go and\n",
      "let her have them all to herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children moved away, but Philip himself was the very last to stir from the garden-gate.\n",
      "He stayed, first, to tell Susan that it was Rose who tied the ribbons on Daisy's head. Then\n",
      "he stayed a little longer to let her hear the story of the guinea-fowl, and to tell her who\n",
      "it was that brought the hen home from the Abbey.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Philip finished speaking, Susan was already feeding her long-lost favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was done, which it certainly never could have been had Philip not held the hen for\n",
      "Susan, he remembered his mother had given him a message for Mrs. Price. This led to another\n",
      "quarter of an hour's delay, for Philip had the whole story of the guinea-hen to tell over again\n",
      "to Mrs. Price, and as the farmer came in while it was going on, it was only polite to begin\n",
      "at the beginning once more. Farmer Price was so pleased to see Susan happy again with her two\n",
      "favorites, that he said he must himself see Daisy fed, and Philip found that he was wanted\n",
      "to hold the jug of milk, from which Susan's father now filled the pan for Daisy. When Philip\n",
      "at last left the cottage, Bab and her maid Betty were staring out of the window as usual.\n",

      "BARBARA'S ACCIDENT\n",
      "\n",
      "As the day went on, Miss Barbara became more and more annoyed that her meanness had been found\n",
      "out, but she had no wish to cure herself of the fault. The ball was still her first thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" she said to Betty, \"you have heard how things have turned out, but if Miss Somers does\n",
      "not ask me to go with, her, I think I know some one else who will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, some officers were quartered at the town where the ball was to be held. And because they\n",
      "had got into trouble with a tradesman there, out of which Mr. Case had undertaken to help them,\n",
      "they sometimes invited the Attorney to mess. The officers thought that if they showed some\n",
      "attention to Mr. Case, he would not charge them so much for his help. One of them even asked\n",
      "his wife to take, sometimes, a little notice of Miss Barbara. The name of this officer's wife\n",
      "was Mrs. Strathspey. It was of Mrs. Strathspey that Barbara was thinking when she said to Betty\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Strathspey and the officers are to breakfast here to-morrow,\" said Bab. \"One of them\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Susan,\" she said to the poor girl whom she had done everything in her power to hurt, \"I must\n",
      "beg a little more honey from you for Mrs. Strathspey's breakfast. You know, at a great time\n",
      "such as this, we should help one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure we should,\" added Betty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan, though she was generous, was not weak; she was willing to give to those she loved, but\n",
      "would not let anything be taken from her or coaxed out of her by those whom she could not respect.\n",
      "She answered that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara grew angry. \"You need not think of balls, for those lumps and swellings won't go off\n",
      "your face this week. That's not what I mind; I'm thinking of what your papa will say to me\n",
      "when he sees you, miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan, seeing she could be of no further use, was about to leave the house, when at the door\n",
      "she met Mr. Case coming in. Now, since his second visit to the Abbey, the Attorney had been\n",
      "thinking things over. It was clear that both Sir Arthur and Miss Somers thought highly of the\n",
      "Price family, so perhaps it was a mistake on his part not to be on friendly terms with them\n",
      "too. He felt sure that if the story of Susan's lamb ever reached the Abbey, Sir Arthur would\n",
      "have no more to do with him. It would therefore be well to get into the good graces of the\n",
      "farmer and his family. So when Mr. Case met Susan at the door he smiled and said, \"How is your\n",
      "mother? Have you called for something that may be of use to her? Barbara, Barbara--Bab, come\n",
      "downstairs, child, and see what you can do for Susan Price.\" But no Barbara answered, and her\n",
      "father stalked upstairs to her room. There he stood still, amazed at the sight of his daughter's\n",
      "swollen face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Mr. Case could speak, Betty began to tell the story of Barbara's mishap in her own way.\n",
      "Barbara spoke at the same time, giving quite another account of what had happened. The Attorney\n",
      "turned the maid away on the spot, and turning to Barbara asked how she dared to treat Susan\n",
      "Price so ill, \"when,\" as he said, \"she was kind enough to give you some of her honey. I will\n",
      "not let you treat her so.\" Susan, who could not but hear all that was said, now went to beg\n",
      "the angry father to forgive his daughter.\n",

      "\"You are too good to her, as indeed you are to everybody,\" he said. \"I forgive her for your sake.\"\n",

      "and she left his house as soon as she could to get ready her mother's breakfast. Mr. Case saw\n",
      "that Simple Susan was not to be taken in by a few simple words, and when he tried in the same\n",

      "The ballroom was filled early in the evening. There was a large gathering. Six ladies and six\n",

      "\n",
      "There was now silence. The first harp sounded, and as each harper tried his skill, those who\n",
      "listened seemed to think that he deserved the prize. The old blind man was the last. He tuned\n",
      "his harp, and such a simple, sad strain was heard as touched every heart. All were delighted,\n",
      "and when the music ceased there was still silence for some moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence was followed by loud cheers. The judges were all agreed that the old blind harper,\n",
      "who had played last, deserved the prize. The simple, sad air, which had moved all who listened,\n",
      "was composed by himself. He was asked to give the words belonging to the music, and at last\n",
      "he modestly said he would repeat them, as he could not see to write. Miss Somers took her pencil,\n",

      "\"Why, sir, true enough it's mine, but you are welcome to it. I can trust you to find me another\n",
      "bit worth the same, or to make up the value of it in some other way. I need say no more.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" replied the farmer, \"the truth is the fit thing to be spoken at all times. I can\n",
      "show you a letter from your brother who had the estate before you, and who let the farm to\n",
      "me. That letter shows what he meant, Sir Arthur, and if in the writing of the lease it was\n",
      "otherwise said, it is, as you say, a mistake, sir. Now a mistake is a mistake all the world\n",
      "over, and should be treated as such, but Attorney Case says in the matter of a lease you must\n",
      "abide by the mistake as though it were the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem,\" said Sir Arthur, \"to have some quarrel with this Attorney of whom you talk so often.\n",
      "Now would you mind telling me frankly what is the matter between you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The matter between us, sir, is this,\" said Price. \"You know the corner of the field with the\n",
      "pink hawthorn near Mr. Case's house? The lane runs past one side of it and a sweetbrier hedge\n",
      "separates it on the other from his garden. Well, sir, the Attorney wishes to enclose that bit\n",
      "of ground with his own, and as it belongs to the village, and moreover is a play-green for\n",
      "the children, and it has been their custom to meet by the hawthorn every Mayday for as many\n",
      "years as I can remember, I was loth to see them turned out of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go together and look at this piece of ground,\" said Sir Arthur. \"It is not far off, is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, sir, close by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the ground, Mr. Case saw them from his garden and hurried to the spot. He\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, Sir Arthur,\" said Attorney Case, seeing that he was too late, \"let there be no dispute\n",
      "about the ground. Let it belong to the village if you will. I give up all claim to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you know well, Mr. Case, that a man cannot give up claim to a place which is not his.\n",
      "You cannot give up this piece of land, for you have no claim to it, as I can prove to you by\n",
      "a look at my maps. This field used to belong to the farm on the other side of the road, but\n",
      "was cut off from it when the lane was made.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you must know best,\" said the trembling Attorney, who was afraid of Sir Arthur and\n",
      "enraged to be shown in the wrong before Farmer Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said Sir Arthur to the farmer, \"you understand that this little green is to be a playground\n",
      "for the village children, and I hope they may gather hawthorn from their favorite bush for\n",
      "many a Mayday to come.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Yes, I thought it my duty to do so. I hope it will not hurt the good farmer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it will not hurt him,\" said Sir Arthur. \"I am willing to write a new one for him when\n",
      "he pleases. He has a letter from my brother who let the farm to him, which shows exactly what\n",
      "was meant, even if there was a mistake made in making out the lease. I hope I shall never treat\n",
      "any one unfairly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said the Attorney, \"but I always thought if there was a mistake in a lease it\n",
      "was fair to take advantage of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you shall be judged by your own words,\" answered Sir Arthur. \"You meant to send me Farmer\n",
      "Price's lease, but your son has somehow brought me yours instead. I have found a bad mistake\n",
      "in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A bad mistake in my lease!\" gasped the alarmed Attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Sir Arthur, pulling the lease out of his pocket. \"Here it is. You will see it\n",
      "has not been signed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you won't take advantage of a mistake, surely!\" said the Attorney, who seemed to forget\n",
      "that he had shortly before said that it was fair to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not take advantage of you as you would have done of this honest man,\" replied Sir\n",

      "parish within one month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney knew it was useless to reply. He therefore turned and sneaked away. I want no\n",
      "one to do my hard work. I only want a steady, honest man, like you, to collect my rents, and\n",
      "I hope, Mr. Price, you will do that for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope, sir,\" said Price, with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest face, \"that I'll never\n",

      "\"It is for Susan, my dear brother. I knew she did not keep that guinea for herself,\" said Miss\n",

      "By JANE TAYLOR\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little girl called Fanny, who had the misfortune one day to bite her tongue as\n",
      "she was eating her breakfast. It hurt her so much that she could scarcely help crying; and\n",
      "even when the first smart was over, it continued so sore that whenever she spoke it pained\n",
      "her considerably. Finding this to be the case, she said very pitifully to her mother, \"Mamma,\n",
      "you can't think how it hurts me when I speak!\" \"Does it?\" replied her mother; \"then I'll tell\n",
      "you what I would advise you to do. Resolve all this day to say nothing but what is either necessary\n",
      "or useful; this will give your tongue a fine holiday, and may answer more purposes than one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny, knowing that she had the character of being somewhat loquacious, could not help laughing\n",
      "at this, and said, \"Well, I will try for once; so, mum! I am going to begin now, mamma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother. Do so; and whenever you are beginning to speak, be sure you ask yourself whether what\n",
      "you were going to say was likely to be of any use, or whether it was necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. Yes, yes, I will! but don't talk to me, mamma, for fear. So saying, she screwed up her\n",
      "lips, and taking her work, sat for about five minutes as still as a mouse. She then looked\n",
      "up, smiled and nodded at her mother, as much as to say, \"See how well I can hold my tongue,\"\n",
      "still screwing her lips very tight for fear she should speak. Soon, however, she began to feel\n",
      "a great inclination to say something; and was glad to recollect that if she could but think\n",
      "of anything either useful or necessary, she might speak. Whereupon she endeavored to find something\n",
      "to say that would come \"within the act.\" To aid her invention, she looked all round the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. Mamma, don't you think the fire wants stirring? (This question, she thought, savored\n",
      "of both qualifications.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother. Not at present, my dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed another long silence; for Fanny found it vastly more difficult than she had any\n",
      "previous idea of, to think of anything useful to talk about; and she knew her mamma would laugh\n",
      "at her if she said what was obviously idle or silly, just now. She was beginning to repent\n",
      "having made such an agreement, when her three elder sisters entered the room. She now thought\n",
      "it quite reasonable, if not absolutely necessary, to tell them of her misfortune; which she\n",
      "did at considerable length, and with many needless digressions (the usual custom with great\n",
      "talkers); upon which they all laughed, prophesying that her resolution would not last half\n",
      "an hour, and rallying her for telling such a long story with a sore tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, some ladies called to pay their mother a morning visit. This gave Fanny's tongue\n",
      "such a long rest that the moment they were gone it seemed irresistibly to resume its wonted\n",
      "functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. What a while old Mrs. W. has had that brown satin pelisse! Really, poor old lady, I\n",

      "\n",
      "Mother. How is your tongue, Fanny?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. Oh, better, mamma, thank you--almost well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother. I am sorry for it: I was in hopes it would have been sore enough at least to prevent\n",
      "your making impertinent remarks upon anybody all this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. No, but really, mamma, is it not an old rubbishing thing?\n",

      "Mother. I don't know, indeed. It is no business of mine; therefore I took no notice of it.\n",

      "time with her eyes fixed on their opposite neighbor's window, suddenly exclaimed, \"I do believe\n",
      "the Joneses are going to have company again to-day! The servant has just been lighting the\n",
      "fire in the drawing-room; and there is Miss Jones now gone up to dress. I saw her draw down\n",
      "the blinds in her room this instant.\" \"So she is,\" said Lucy, looking up: \"I never knew such\n",
      "people in my life! they are always having company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder whom they are expecting to-day,\" said Eliza; \"dinner-company, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The proceedings of their neighbors, the Joneses, continued to furnish matter for various sagacious\n",
      "conjectures and remarks for a considerable time. At length Caroline exclaimed with the eagerness\n",
      "of discovery, \"Look! look! there's the baker now at the door, with a whole tray full of tarts\n",
      "and things. Make haste, or he'll be gone in.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Lucy. If Miss Jones is not dressed already! She is this instant come into the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caroline. Stand back, stand back! Don't let her see us all staring. Ah, there she is,--got\n",
      "on her pink sarcenet body and sleeves to-day. How pretty that dress is, to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliza. And how nicely she has done her hair! Look, Caroline--braided behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy. There, she is putting down the sash. That chimney smokes, I know, with this wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. And there is that little figure, Martha Jones, come down now. Do look--as broad as she\n",
      "is long! What a little fright that child is, to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother. Pray, Fanny, was that remark useful or necessary?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny. Oh, but mamma, I assure you, my tongue is quite well now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother. I am sorry for it, my dear. Do you know, I should think it well worth while to bite\n",
      "my tongue every day if there were no other means of keeping it in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the girls laughed; but their mother, resuming her gravity, thus continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear girls, I should before now have put a stop to this idle gossiping, if I had not hoped\n",
      "to convince you of the folly of it. It is no wonder, I confess, that at your age you should\n",
      "learn to imitate a style of remark which is but too prevalent in society. Nothing, indeed,\n",
      "is more contagious. But let me also tell you, that girls of your age, and of your advantages,\n",
      "are capable of seeing the meanness of it, and ought to despise it. It is the chief end of education\n",
      "to raise the minds of women above such trifling as this. But if a young person who has been\n",
      "taught to think, whose taste has been cultivated, and who might therefore possess internal\n",
      "resources, has as much idle curiosity about the affairs of her neighbors, and is as fond of\n",
      "retailing petty scandal concerning them, as an uneducated woman, it proves that her mind is\n",
      "incurably mean and vulgar, and that cultivation is lost upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This sort of gossiping, my dear girls, is the disgrace of our sex. The pursuits of women lie\n",
      "necessarily within a narrow sphere, and they naturally sink, unless raised by refinement, or\n",
      "by strong principle, into that littleness of character, for which even their own husbands and\n",
      "fathers (if they are men of sense) are tempted to despise them. The minds of men, from their\n",
      "engagements in business, necessarily take a larger range; and they are, in general, too much\n",
      "occupied with concerns comparatively important to enter into the minute details which amuse\n",
      "women. But women of education have no such plea to urge. When your father and I direct you\n",
      "to this or that pursuit, it is not so much for the sake of your possessing that particular\n",
      "branch of knowledge, but that by knowledge in general you may become intelligent and superior,\n",
      "and that you may be furnished with resources which will save you from the miserable necessity\n",
      "of seeking amusement from intercourse with your neighbors, and an acquaintance with their affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us suppose, now, that this morning you had been all more industriously inclined; and had\n",
      "been engaged in any of your employments with that ardor which some happy young people manifest\n",
      "in the acquisition of knowledge; would you, in that case, have felt any desire to know the\n",
      "date of Mrs. W.'s pelisse, or any curiosity in the proceedings of our neighbors the Joneses?\n",
      "No, you would then have thought it a most impertinent interruption, if any one had attempted\n",
      "to entertain you with such particulars. But when the mind is indolent and empty, then it can\n",
      "receive amusement from the most contemptible sources. Learn, then, to check this mean propensity.\n",
      "Despise such thoughts whenever you are tempted to indulge them. Recollect that this low curiosity\n",
      "is the combined result of idleness, ignorance, emptiness, and ill-nature; and fly to useful\n",
      "occupation, as the most successful antidote against the evil. Nor let it be forgotten that\n",
      "such impertinent remarks as these come directly under the description of those 'idle words,'\n",
      "of which an account must be given in the day of judgment. Yes, this vulgar trifling is as inconsistent\n",
      "with the spirit of Christian benevolence, and with the grand rule of 'doing to others as we\n",

      "\"It would be a fortunate bite for you, Fanny,\" said her mother, \"and for your neighbors, if\n",
      "it should make you more careful in the use of it. If we were liable to such a misfortune whenever\n",
      "we use our tongues improperly, some persons would be in a constant agony. Now, if our consciences\n",

      "talking pains a good conscience, just as continual speaking hurts a sore tongue; and if we\n",

      "One day Beechnut, who had been ill, was taken by Phonny and Madeline for a drive. When Phonny\n",
      "and Madeline found themselves riding quietly along in the wagon in Beechnut's company, the\n",
      "first thought which occurred to them, after the interest and excitement awakened by the setting\n",
      "out had passed in some measure away, was that they would ask him to tell them a story. This\n",
      "was a request which they almost always made in similar circumstances. In all their rides and\n",
      "rambles Beechnut's stories were an unfailing resource, furnishing them with an inexhaustible\n",
      "fund of amusement sometimes, and sometimes of instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Beechnut, in answer to their request, \"I will tell you now about my voyage across\n",

      "\"I want to have it true,\" said Madeline, \"and interesting, too.\"\n",

      "\"But sometimes,\" replied Beechnut, \"interesting things don't happen, and in such cases, if\n",
      "we should only relate what actually does happen, the story would be likely to be dull.\"\n",

      "\"There seemed to be nothing,\" continued Beechnut, \"for me to do, and nothing desirable for\n",

      "if he should come to America, where he said people might rise in the world, according to their\n",

      "\"Well,\" said Phonny, \"I think you were an extraordinary boy.\"\n",

      "\"So do I,\" said Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said,\" continued Beechnut, \"he thought it would in the end be a great deal better for him\n",
      "to come to America, where I might become a man of some consequence in the world, and he said\n",
      "that he should enjoy his own old age a great deal better, even in a strange land, if he could\n",
      "see me going on prosperously in life, than to remain all his days in that porter's lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the money that my father had saved,\" Beechnut continued, \"he got changed into gold at\n",
      "an office in the Bouleyard; but then he was very much perplexed to decide how it was best to\n",
      "carry it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did he not pack it up in his chest?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was afraid,\" replied Beechnut, \"that his chest might be broken open, or unlocked by false\n",
      "keys, on the voyage, and that the money might be thus stolen away; so he thought that he would\n",
      "try to hide it somewhere in some small thing that he could keep with him all the voyage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could not he keep his chest with him all the voyage?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Beechnut; \"the chests, and all large parcels of baggage belonging to the passengers,\n",
      "must be sent down into the hold of the ship out of the way. It is only a very little baggage\n",
      "that the people are allowed to keep with them between the decks. My father wished very much\n",
      "to keep his gold with him, and yet he was afraid to keep it in a bag, or in any other similar\n",
      "package, in his little trunk, for then whoever saw it would know that it was gold, and so perhaps\n",
      "form some plan to rob him of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While we were considering what plan it would be best to adopt for the gold, Arielle, who was\n",
      "the daughter of a friend of ours, proposed to hide it in my top. I had a very large top which\n",
      "my father had made for me. It was painted yellow outside, with four stripes of bright blue\n",
      "passing down over it from the stem to the point. When the top was in motion, both the yellow\n",
      "ground and the blue stripes entirely disappeared, and the top appeared to be of a uniform green\n",
      "color. Then, when it came to its rest again, the original colors would reappear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How curious!\" said Madeline. \"Why would it do so?\" \"Why, when it was revolving,\" said Beechnut,\n",
      "\"the yellow and the blue were blended together in the eye, and that made green. Yellow and\n",
      "blue always make green. Arielle colored my top, after my father had made it, and then my father\n",
      "varnished it over the colors, and that fixed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This top of mine was a monstrous large one, and being hollow, Arielle thought that the gold\n",
      "could all be put inside. She said she thought that that would be a very safe hiding-place,\n",
      "too, since nobody would think of looking into a top for gold. But my father said that he thought\n",
      "that the space would not be quite large enough, and then if anybody should happen to see the\n",
      "top, and should touch it, the weight of it would immediately reveal the secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At last my father thought of a plan which he believed would answer the purpose very perfectly.\n",
      "We had a very curious old clock. It was made by my grandfather, who was a clockmaker in Geneva.\n",
      "There was a little door in the face of the clock, and whenever the time came for striking the\n",
      "hours, this door would open, and a little platform would come out with a tree upon it. There\n",
      "was a beautiful little bird upon the tree, and when the clock had done striking, the bird would\n",
      "flap its wings and sing. Then the platform would slide back into its place, the door would\n",
      "shut, and the clock go on ticking quietly for another hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This clock was made to go,\" continued Beechnut, \"as many other clocks are, by two heavy weights,\n",
      "which were hung to the wheel-work by strong cords. The cords were wound round some of the wheels,\n",
      "and as they slowly descended by their weight, they made the wheels go round. There was a contrivance\n",
      "inside the clock to make the wheels go slowly and regularly, and not spin round too fast, as\n",
      "they would have done if the weights had been left to themselves. This is the way that clocks\n",
      "are often made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my father,\" continued Beechnut, \"had intended to take this old family clock with him\n",
      "to America, and he now conceived the idea of hiding his treasure in the weights. The weights\n",
      "were formed of two round tin canisters filled with something very heavy. My father said he\n",
      "did not know whether it was shot or sand. He unsoldered the bottom from these canisters, and\n",
      "found that the filling was shot. He poured out the shot, put his gold pieces in in place of\n",
      "it, and then filled up all the interstices between and around the gold pieces with sand, to\n",
      "prevent the money from jingling. Then he soldered the bottom of the canisters on again, and\n",
      "no one would have known that the weights were anything more than ordinary clock-weights. He\n",
      "then packed the clock in a box, and put the box in his trunk. It did not take up a great deal\n",
      "of room, for he did not take the case of the clock, but only the face and the works and the\n",
      "two weights, which last he packed carefully and securely in the box, one on each side of the\n",
      "clock itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we got to Havre, all our baggage was examined at the Custom House, and the officers allowed\n",
      "it all to pass. When they came to the clock, my father showed them the little door and the\n",
      "bird inside, and they said it was very curious. They did not pay any attention to the weights\n",
      "at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we went on board of the vessel our chests were put by the side of an immense heap of\n",
      "baggage upon the deck, where some seamen were at work lowering it down into the hold through\n",
      "a square opening in the deck of the ship. As for the trunk, my father took that with him to\n",
      "the place where he was going to be himself during the voyage. This place was called the steerage.\n",
      "It was crowded full of men, women, and children, all going to America. Some talked French,\n",
      "some German, some Dutch, and there were ever so many babies that were too little to talk at\n",
      "all. Pretty soon the vessel sailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We did not meet with anything remarkable on the voyage, except that once we saw an iceberg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\" asked Madeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a great mountain of ice,\" replied Beechnut, \"floating about in the sea on the top of\n",
      "the water. I don't know how it comes to be there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not think it would float upon the top of the water,\" said Phonny. \"All the ice that\n",
      "I ever saw in the water sinks into it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It does not sink to the bottom,\" said Madeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Phonny, \"but it sinks down until the top of the ice is just level with the water.\n",
      "But Beechnut says that his iceberg rose up like a mountain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Beechnut, \"it was several hundred feet high above the water, all glittering in\n",
      "the sun. And I think that if you look at any small piece of ice floating in the water, you\n",
      "will see that a small part of it rises above the surface.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Phenny, \"a very little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a certain proportion of the whole mass,\" rejoined Beechnut. \"They told us on board our\n",
      "vessel that about one-tenth part of the iceberg was above the water; the rest--that is, nine-tenths--was\n",
      "under it; so you see what an enormous big piece of ice it must have been to have only one-tenth\n",
      "part of it tower up so high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was one thing very curious and beautiful about our iceberg,\" said Beechnut. \"We came\n",
      "in sight of it one day about sunset, just after a shower. The cloud, which was very large and\n",
      "black, had passed off into the west, and there was a splendid rainbow upon it. It happened,\n",
      "too, that when we were nearest to the iceberg it lay toward the west, and, of course, toward\n",
      "the cloud, and it appeared directly under the rainbow, and the iceberg and the rainbow made\n",
      "a most magnificent spectacle. The iceberg, which was very bright and dazzling in the evening\n",
      "sun, looked like an enormous diamond, with the rainbow for the setting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How curious!\" said Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Beechnut, \"and to make it more remarkable still, a whale just then came along directly\n",
      "before the iceberg, and spouted there two or three times; and as the sun shone very brilliantly\n",
      "upon the jet of water which the whale threw into the air, it made a sort of silver rainbow\n",
      "below in the center of the picture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How beautiful it must have been!\" said Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" rejoined Beechnut, \"very beautiful indeed. We saw a great many beautiful spectacles\n",
      "on the sea; but then, on the other hand, we saw some that were dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you?\" asked Phonny. \"What?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, we had a terrible storm and shipwreck at the end,\" said Beechnut. \"For three days and\n",
      "three nights the wind blew almost a hurricane. They took in all the sails, and let the ship\n",
      "drive before the gale under bare poles. She went on over the seas for five hundred miles, howling\n",
      "all the way like a frightened dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were you frightened?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Beechnut. \"When the storm first came on, several of the passengers came up the\n",
      "hatchways and got up on the deck to see it; and then we could not get down again, for the ship\n",
      "gave a sudden pitch just after we came up, and knocked away the step-ladder. We were terribly\n",
      "frightened. The seas were breaking over the forecastle and sweeping along the decks, and the\n",
      "shouts and outcries of the captain and the sailors made a dreadful din. At last they put the\n",
      "step-ladder in its place again, and we got down. Then they put the hatches on, and we could\n",
      "not come out any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hatches?\" said Phonny. \"What are they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hatches,\" replied Beechnut, \"are a sort of scuttle-doors that cover over the square openings\n",
      "in the deck of a ship. They always have to put them on and fasten them down in a great storm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this time the party happened to arrive at a place where two roads met, and as there\n",
      "was a broad and level space of ground at the junction, where it would be easy to turn the wagon,\n",
      "Beechnut said that he thought it would be better to make that the end of their ride, and so\n",
      "turn round and go home. Phonny and Madeline were quite desirous of going a little farther,\n",
      "but Beechnut thought that he should be tired by the time he reached the house again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will not have time to finish the story,\" said Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Beechnut; \"there is very little more to tell. It is only to give an account\n",
      "of our shipwreck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, did you have a shipwreck?\" exclaimed Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Beechnut. \"When you have turned the wagon, I will tell you about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Phonny, taking a great sweep, turned the wagon round, and the party set their faces toward\n",
      "home. The Marshal was immediately going to set out upon a trot, but Phonny held him back by\n",
      "pulling upon the reins and saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steady, Marshal! steady! You have got to walk all the way home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The storm drove us upon the Nova Scotia coast,\" said Beechnut, resuming his story. \"We did\n",
      "not know anything about the great danger that we were in until just before the ship went ashore.\n",
      "When we got near the shore the sailors put down all the anchors; but they would not hold, and\n",
      "at length the ship struck. Then there followed a dreadful scene of consternation and confusion.\n",
      "Some jumped into the sea in their terror, and were drowned. Some cried and screamed, and acted\n",
      "as if they were insane. Some were calm, and behaved rationally. The sailors opened the hatches\n",
      "and let the passengers come up, and we got into the most sheltered places that we could find\n",
      "about the decks and rigging, and tied ourselves to whatever was nearest at hand. My father\n",
      "opened his trunk and took out his two clock-weights, and gave me one of them; the other he\n",
      "kept himself. He told me that we might as well try to save them, though he did not suppose\n",
      "that we should be able to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty soon after we struck the storm seemed to abate a little. The people of the country\n",
      "came down to the shore and stood upon the rocks to see if they could do anything to save us.\n",
      "We were very near the shore, but the breakers and the boiling surf were so violent between\n",
      "us and the land that whoever took to the water was sure to be dashed in pieces. So everybody\n",
      "clung to the ship, waiting for the captain to contrive some way to get us to the shore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what did he do?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He first got a long line and a cask, and he fastened the end of the long line to the cask,\n",
      "and then threw the cask overboard. The other end of the line was kept on board the ship. The\n",
      "cask was tossed about upon the waves, every successive surge driving it in nearer and nearer\n",
      "to the shore, until at last it was thrown up high upon the rocks. The men upon the shore ran\n",
      "to seize it, but before they could get hold of it the receding wave carried it back again among\n",
      "the breakers, where it was tossed about as if it had been a feather, and overwhelmed with the\n",
      "spray. Presently away it went again up upon the shore, and the men again attempted to seize\n",
      "it. This was repeated two or three times. At last they succeeded in grasping hold of it, and\n",
      "they ran up with it upon the rocks, out of the reach of the seas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The captain then made signs to the men to pull the line in toward the shore. He was obliged\n",
      "to use signs, because the roaring and thundering of the seas made such a noise that nothing\n",
      "could be heard. The sailors had before this, under the captain's direction, fastened a much\n",
      "stronger line--a small cable, in fact--to the end of the line which had been attached to the\n",
      "barrel. Thus, by pulling upon the smaller line, the men drew one end of the cable to the shore.\n",
      "The other end remained on board the ship, while the middle of it lay tossing among the breakers\n",
      "between the ship and the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The seamen then carried that part of the cable which was on shipboard up to the masthead,\n",
      "while the men on shore made their end fast to a very strong post which they set in the ground.\n",
      "The seamen drew the cable as tight as they could, and fastened their end very strongly to the\n",
      "masthead. Thus the line of the cable passed in a gentle slope from the top of the mast to the\n",
      "land, high above all the surges and spray. The captain then rigged what he called a sling,\n",
      "which was a sort of loop of ropes that a person could be put into and made to slide down in\n",
      "it on the cable to the shore. A great many of the passengers were afraid to go in this way,\n",
      "but they were still more afraid to remain on board the ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What were they afraid of?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were afraid,\" replied Beechnut, \"that the shocks of the seas would soon break the ship\n",
      "to pieces, and then they would all be thrown into the sea together. In this case they would\n",
      "certainly be destroyed, for if they were not drowned, they would be dashed to pieces on the\n",
      "rocks which lined the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sliding down the line seemed thus a very dangerous attempt, but they consented one after another\n",
      "to make the trial, and thus we all escaped safe to land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did you get the clock-weights safe to the shore?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Beechnut, \"and as soon as we landed we hid them in the sand. My father took\n",
      "me to a little cove close by, where there was not much surf, as the place was protected by\n",
      "a rocky point of land which bounded it on one side. Behind this point of land the waves rolled\n",
      "up quietly upon a sandy beach. My father went down upon the slope of this beach, to a place\n",
      "a little below where the highest waves came, and began to dig a hole in the sand. He called\n",
      "me to come and help him. The waves impeded our work a little, but we persevered until we had\n",
      "dug a hole about a foot deep. We put our clock-weights into this hole and covered them over.\n",
      "We then ran back up upon the beach. The waves that came up every moment over the place soon\n",
      "smoothed the surface of the sand again, and made it look as if nothing had been done there.\n",
      "My father measured the distance from the place where he had deposited his treasure up to a\n",
      "certain great white rock upon the shore exactly opposite to it, so as to be able to find the\n",
      "place again, and then we went back to our company. They were collected on the rocks in little\n",
      "groups, wet and tired, and in great confusion, but rejoiced at having escaped with their lives.\n",
      "Some of the last of the sailors were then coming over in the sling. The captain himself came\n",
      "last of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There were some huts near the place on the shore, where the men made good fires, and we warmed\n",
      "and dried ourselves. The storm abated a great deal in a few hours, and the tide went down,\n",
      "so that we could go off to the ship before night to get some provisions. The next morning the\n",
      "men could work at the ship very easily, and they brought all the passengers' baggage on shore.\n",
      "My father got his trunk with the clock in it. A day or two afterward some sloops came to the\n",
      "place, and took us all away to carry us to Quebec. Just before we embarked on board the sloops,\n",
      "my father and I, watching a good opportunity, dug up our weights out of the sand, and put them\n",
      "back safely in their places in the clock-box.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that the end?\" asked Phonny, when Beechnut paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Beechnut, \"I believe I had better make that the end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it is a very interesting and well-told story,\" said Madeline. \"And do you feel very\n",
      "tired?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Beechnut. \"On the contrary, I feel all the better for my ride. I believe I will\n",
      "sit up a little while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he raised himself in the wagon and sat up, and began to look about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a wonderful voyage you had, Beechnut!\" said Phonny. \"But I never knew before that you\n",
      "were shipwrecked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, in point of fact,\" replied Beechnut, \"I never was shipwrecked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never was!\" exclaimed Phonny. \"Why, what is all this story that you have been telling us, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Embellishment,\" said Beechnut quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Embellishment!\" repeated Phonny, more and more amazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Beechnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you were not wrecked at all?\" said Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Beechnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did you get to the land?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, we sailed quietly up the St. Lawrence,\" replied Beechnut, \"and landed safely at Quebec,\n",
      "as other vessels do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the clock-weights?\" asked Phonny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All embellishment,\" said Beechnut. \"My father had no such clock, in point of fact. He put\n",
      "his money in a bag, his bag in his chest, and his chest in the hold, and it came as safe as\n",
      "the captain's sextant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the iceberg and the rainbow?\" said Madeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Embellishment, all embellishment,\" said Beechnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" said Phonny, \"I thought it was all true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you?\" said Beechnut. \"I am sorry that you were so deceived, and I am sure it was not my\n",
      "fault, for I gave you your choice of a true story or an invention, and you chose the invention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Phonny, \"so we did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began to scream and to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not cry, my sweet soul,\" said his mother, \"and we will see what we can do. However, I will try.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went on a little further, and saw a man wading about in a pool of water without being\n",
      "able to get out, in spite of all his endeavors. \"There,\" said he, \"now you are nicely seated\n",
      "I am going to feed you.\" Although you escape now, be assured, sir, that if you do not repent\n",
      "and mend your manners, you will meet with a severe punishment for your bad behavior.\"\n",

      "\"Well, then, mamma, there are buckles; you know that buckles are useful things, very useful\n",
      "things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a pair of buckles; I don't want another pair,\" said her mother, and walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, my dear, I want you to think for yourself; you will have time enough to consider the\n",
      "matter, while I speak to Mr. Sole about my clogs.\"\n",

      "\"Please, your lordship, I was sitting at work by my fireside between the hours of six and seven\n",
      "in the evening, just as it was growing dusk, and little Jack was spinning beside me, when all\n",
      "at once crack went the window, and down fell a little basket of cakes that was set up against\n",
      "it. I started up and cried to Jack: 'Bless me, what's the matter?' 'So,' says Jack, 'sombody\n",
      "has thrown a stone and broke the window, and I dare say it is some of the schoolboys.' With\n",
      "that I ran out of the house, and saw some boys making off as fast as they could go. So I ran\n",
      "after them as quick as my old legs would carry me, but I should never have come near them if\n",
      "one had not happened to fall down. Him I caught and brought back to my house, when Jack knew\n",
      "him at once to be Master Henry Luckless. So I told him I would complain of him the next day,\n",
      "and I hope your worship will make him pay the damage, and I think he deserves a good whipping\n",
      "into the bargain for injuring a poor widow woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Judge, having heard Mrs. Careful's story, desired her to sit down, and then calling up\n",
      "Master Luckless, asked him what he had to say for himself. Luckless appeared with his face\n",
      "a good deal scratched, and looking very ruefully. After making his bow and sobbing two or three\n",
      "times, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord, I am as innocent of this matter as any boy in the school, and I am sure I have suffered\n",
      "enough about it already. My lord, Billy Thompson and I were playing in the lane near Mrs. Careful's\n",
      "house when we heard the window crash, and directly after she came running out towards us. Upon\n",
      "this Billy ran away, and I ran too, thinking I might bear the blame. But after running a little\n",
      "way I stumbled over something that lay in the road, and before I could get up again she overtook\n",
      "me, and caught me by the hair, and began lugging and cuffing me. I told her it was not I that\n",
      "broke her window, but it did not signify; so she dragged me to the light, lugging and scratching\n",
      "me all the while, and then said she would inform against me. And that is all I know of the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I find, good woman,\" said the Judge, \"you were willing to revenge yourself without waiting\n",
      "for the justice of this court.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord, I must confess I was put into a passion, and did not properly consider what I was doing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, where is Billy Thompson?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, my lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard what Henry Luckless says. Declare upon your honor whether he has spoken the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said Billy, \"I am sure neither he nor I had any concern in breaking the window.\n",
      "We were standing together at the time, and I ran on hearing the door open, for fear of being\n",
      "charged with it, and he followed; but what became of him I did not stay to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you let your friend,\" the Judge remarked, \"shift for himself, and thought only of saving\n",
      "yourself. But did you see any other person about the house or in the lane?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord, I thought I heard some one creeping along the other side of the hedge a little before\n",
      "the window was broken, but I saw nobody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hear, good woman, what is alleged in behalf of the person you have accused. Have you any\n",
      "other evidence against him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One might be sure,\" the widow replied, \"they would deny it, and tell lies for one another;\n",
      "but I hope I am not to be put off in that manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must tell you, mistress, that you give too much liberty to your tongue, and are as guilty\n",
      "of as much injustice as that of which you complain. I should be sorry indeed if the young gentlemen\n",
      "of this school deserved the general character of liars. You will find among us, I hope, as\n",
      "just a sense of what is right and honorable as among those who are older, and our worthy master\n",
      "would certainly not permit us to try offences in this manner if he thought us capable of bearing\n",
      "false witness in each other's favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I ask your lordship's pardon; I did not mean to offend; but it is a heavy loss for a poor\n",
      "woman, and though I did not catch the boy in the act, he was the nearest when it was done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As that is no more than a suspicion, and he has the positive evidence of his schoolfellow\n",
      "in his favor, it will be impossible to convict him consistently with the rules of justice.\n",
      "Have you discovered any other circumstance that may point out the offender?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord, next morning Jack found on the floor this top, which I suppose the window was broke\n",
      "with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hand it up. Here, gentlemen of the jury, please to examine it, and see if you can discover\n",
      "anything of its owner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is 'P.R.' cut upon it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said another boy, \"I am sure I remember Peter Riot having just such a one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I,\" still another remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master Riot, is this your top?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, my lord,\" said Riot; \"perhaps it may be mine. I have had a great many tops,\n",
      "and when I have done with them I throw them away, and any body may pick them up that pleases.\n",
      "You see, it has lost its peg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, sir. Mrs. Careful, you may retire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And must I have no amends, my lord?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have patience; leave everything to the court. We shall do you all the justice in our power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the widow was gone the Judge rose from his seat, and with much solemnity thus addressed\n",
      "the assembly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen, this business, I confess, gives me much dissatisfaction. A poor woman has been\n",
      "insulted and injured in her property, apparently without provocation, and although she has\n",
      "not been able to convict the offender, it cannot be doubted that she, as well as the world\n",
      "in general, will impute the crime to some of our society. Though I am in my own mind convinced\n",
      "that in her passion she charged an innocent person, yet the circumstance of the top is a strong\n",
      "suspicion--indeed, almost a proof--that the perpetrator of this unmanly mischief was one of\n",
      "our body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The owner of the top has justly observed that its having been his property is no certain proof\n",
      "against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since, therefore, in the present defect of evidence the whole school must remain burdened\n",
      "with both the discredit of this action and share in the guilt of it, I think fit, in the first\n",
      "place, to decree that restitution shall be made to the sufferer out of the public chest, and,\n",
      "next, that a Court of Inquiry be instituted for the express purpose of searching thoroughly\n",
      "into the affair, with the power to examine all persons upon honor who are thought likely to\n",
      "be able to throw light upon it. I hope, gentlemen, these measures meet with your concurrence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole court bowed to the Judge, and expressed their entire satisfaction with his determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then ordered that the Public Treasurer should go to the Widow Careful's house, and pay\n",
      "her a sum of one shilling, making at the same time a handsome apology in the name of the school;\n",
      "and six persons were taken by lot of the jury to compose the Court of Inquiry, which was to\n",
      "sit in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court then adjourned.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the meeting of the Court of Inquiry the first thing proposed by the President was that the\n",
      "persons who usually played with Master Riot should be sent for. Accordingly Tom Frisk and Bob\n",
      "Loiter were summoned, when the President asked them upon their honor if they knew the top to\n",
      "have been Riot's.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said they did. They were then asked if they remembered when Riot had it in his possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He had it,\" said Frisk, \"the day before yesterday, and split a top of mine with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Loiter, \"and then as he was making a stroke at mine the peg flew out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did he do with it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He put it into his pocket, and said as it was a strong top he would have it mended.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he did not throw it away, or give it to any one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; a day or two before he went to the Widow Careful's shop for some gingerbread; but as\n",
      "he already owed her sixpence, she would not let him have any till he had paid his debts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did he take the disappointment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said he would be revenged on her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure he used such words?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Loiter heard him as well as myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did, sir,\" said Loiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do either of you know any more of this affair?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" replied both boys together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may go,\" said the President, adding \"that these witnesses had done a good deal in establishing\n",
      "proof against Riot; for it was pretty certain that no one but himself could have been in possession\n",
      "of the top at the time the crime was committed, and it also appeared that he had declared a\n",
      "malicious intention against the woman, which it was highly probable he would put into execution.\n",
      "As the court were debating about the next step to be taken they were acquainted that Jack,\n",
      "the widow's son, was waiting at the school-door for admission; and a person being sent out\n",
      "for him, Riot was found threatening the boy, and bidding him go home about his business. The\n",
      "boy, however, was conveyed safely into the room, when he thus addressed himself to the President:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, and please your worship,\" said Jack, \"as I was looking about this morning for sticks\n",
      "in the hedge over against our house, I found this buckle. So I thought to myself, 'Sure this\n",
      "must belong to the rascal that broke our window.' So I have brought it to see if any one in\n",
      "the school would own it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On which side of the hedge did you find it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the other side from our house, in the close.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us see it Gentlemen,\" said the President, \"this is so smart a buckle that I am sure I\n",
      "remember it at once, and I dare say you all do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Riot's!\" exclaimed all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has anybody observed Riot's shoes to-day?\" the President asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he has got them tied with strings,\" a boy replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then, gentlemen, we have nothing more to do than to draw up the evidence we have\n",
      "heard, and lay it before his lordship. Jack, you may go home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, sir, let somebody go with me, for I am afraid of Riot, who has just been threatening\n",
      "me at the door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master Bold will please to go along with the boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The minutes of the court were then drawn up, and the President took them to the Judge's chamber.\n",
      "After the Judge had perused them, he ordered an indictment to be drawn up against Peter Riot:\n",
      "\"For that he meanly and clandestinely and with malice aforethought had broken three panes in\n",
      "the window of Widow Careful with a certain instrument called a top, whereby he had committed\n",
      "an atrocious injury upon an innocent person, and had brought a disgrace upon the society to\n",
      "which he belonged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time he sent an officer to inform Master Riot that his trial would come on the\n",
      "next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riot, who was with some of his gay companions, affected to treat the matter with great indifference,\n",
      "and even to make a jest of it. However, in the morning he thought it best to endeavor to make\n",
      "it up, and accordingly, when the court was assembled, he sent one of his friends with a shilling,\n",
      "saying that he would not trouble them with further inquiries, but would pay the sum that had\n",
      "been issued out of the public stock. On the receipt of this message the Judge rose with much\n",
      "severity in his countenance, and observing that by such contemptuous behavior towards the court\n",
      "the criminal had greatly added to his offence, he ordered two officers with their staves immediately\n",
      "to go and bring in Riot, and to use force if he should resist them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culprit, thinking it best to submit, was presently led in between the two officers, when,\n",
      "being placed at the bar, the Judge then addressed him: \"I am sorry, sir, that any member of\n",
      "this society can be so little sensible of the nature of a crime and so little acquainted with\n",
      "the principles of a court of justice as you have shown yourself to be by the proposal you took\n",
      "the improper liberty of sending us. If you mean it as a confession of your guilt, you certainly\n",
      "ought to have waited to receive from us the penalty we thought proper to inflict, and not to\n",
      "have imagined that an offer of the mere payment of damages would satisfy the claims of justice\n",
      "against you. If you had only broken the window by accident, and on your own accord offered\n",
      "restitution, nothing less than the full damages could have been accepted; but you now stand\n",
      "charged with having done this mischief meanly, secretly, and maliciously, and thereby have\n",
      "added a great deal of criminal intention to the act. Can you, then, think that a court like\n",
      "this, designed to watch over the morals, as well as protect the property of our community,\n",
      "can so slightly pass over such aggravated offences? You can claim no merit from confessing\n",
      "the crime now that you know so much evidence will appear against you. And if you choose still\n",
      "to plead not guilty, you are at liberty to do it, and we will proceed immediately to the trial\n",
      "without taking any advantage of the confession implied by your offer of payment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Riot stood silent for some time, and then begged to be allowed to consult with his friends\n",
      "what was the best for him to do. This was agreed to, and he was permitted to retire, though\n",
      "under guard of an officer. After a short absence he returned with more humility in his looks,\n",
      "and said that he pleaded guilty, and threw himself on the mercy of the court. The Judge then\n",
      "made a speech of some length, for the purpose of convincing the prisoner, as well as the bystanders,\n",
      "of the enormity of his crime. He then pronounced the following sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, Peter Riot, are hereby sentenced to pay to the public treasury the sum of half a crown\n",
      "as a satisfaction for this mischief you have done, and your attempt to conceal it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are to repair to the house of Widow Careful, accompanied by such witnesses as we shall\n",
      "appoint, and then, having first paid her the sum you owe her, you shall ask her pardon for\n",
      "the insult you offered her. You shall likewise to-morrow after school stand up in your place\n",
      "and before all the scholars ask pardon for the disgrace you have been the means of bringing\n",
      "upon the society, and in particular you shall apologize to Master Luckless for the disagreeable\n",
      "circumstances you were the means of bringing him into. Till after this is complied with you\n",
      "shall not presume to come into the playground or join in any of the diversions of the school,\n",
      "and all persons are hereby admonished not to keep you company till this is done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Riot was then dismissed to his room, and in the afternoon he was taken to the widow, who was\n",
      "pleased to receive his submission graciously, and at the same time to apologize for her own\n",
      "improper treatment of Master Luckless, to whom she sent a present of a nice ball by way of amends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended this important business. Yes, it is a dreadful thing, and many a little boy has\n",
      "lost his eyesight by it. Next to playing with fire, I do not know anything so bad as playing\n",
      "with gunpowder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one knows of the fifth of November, the day set apart for commemorating the deliverance\n",
      "of King James and his Parliament from the horrible plot to blow them up with gunpowder, and\n",
      "how on that day Guido Fawkes, who was to have put the plan in execution, has his effigy paraded\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was on the fifth of November, in the year 1789, when Peter Parley was a boy, that\n",
      "the circumstances took place of which I am going to give a relation. The boys of those days,\n",
      "I think, were more fond of Guy Fawkes, and bonfires, and squibs, and crackers than they are now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember it was the first of November, early in the morning, that a lad, who was on a visit\n",
      "to my father, and who was my second cousin, got out of bed and said to me (for we both slept\n",
      "in one room):\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peter,\" said he, \"do you have a guy in this town? I had a famous one last year, and such a\n",
      "bonfire as you never saw, for we burnt down a haystack. I should like to have a guy this year;\n",
      "do let us make one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only about twelve years old, and very fond of a bit of fun, and so I said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a good idea. I was thinking of the same thing last night, because the clerk gave out\n",
      "in the church that there would be prayers on the fifth of November, on account of the Gunpowder\n",
      "Plot; and, as I came out of the church porch I saw a very old woman sitting there. She looked\n",
      "just like an old witch, and I said to myself, 'I should like to seize her for a guy.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seize an old woman for a guy! Well, that would be the drollest thing that ever happened,\"\n",
      "said he; \"and I should like to go you halves. Shall we go partners in it? We can easily get\n",
      "a chair and tie her down in it, and get a dark lantern and some matches and all that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she must be dressed like a man,\" said I; \"there never was a female Guy Fawkes. The people\n",
      "would laugh at us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better,\" said he; \"that is just what we want. I like something original, out of\n",
      "the common way. Now, a female Guy Fawkes is a thing that few persons ever saw, or even heard of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But shall we not be taken up,\" said I, \"perhaps put in prison, and get ourselves into a hobble?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what if we do? But we shall not do that. I am sure it is all right enough. But, however,\n",
      "to be quite certain, if you like we will ask Ephraim Quidd. You know, his father is a lawyer,\n",
      "and he will tell us in a minute. So when we go to school we will ask him, shall we?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all my heart,\" said I. And so with that we began to dress ourselves, and went downstairs\n",
      "to breakfast. I was so full of the matter that I sat and thought of it all the time I was eating\n",
      "my food; and at last my imagination painted the old woman sitting in a chair, calling out,\n",
      "\"I am no guy! I am no guy!\" the mob laughing, and the boys hurrahing so vividly that I burst\n",
      "into a fit of laughter myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Peter,\" said my father, \"'what is the matter now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of telling him I continued to laugh, till at last he grew very angry with me, and ordered\n",
      "me from the breakfast-table. I then took my hat and bag, and went off to school. Simon Sapskull--for\n",
      "that was my cousin's name--soon followed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came up with me he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought what you were laughing at. It will be good fun. Let us make haste and see Quidd\n",
      "before he goes in. It will be good fun, won't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And here Master Simon jumped and capered about with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came to the schoolyard there were several boys assembled and Quidd among them. Simon\n",
      "immediately ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quidd,\" said he, \"I want to ask you a question. You know the law, do you not? Your father\n",
      "is the town clerk, and you ought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do know the law,\" said Quidd. \"Have I not been bred to it? And is not my father to be made\n",
      "Recorder next year?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, answer me this,\" said Simon. \"Is there any law against seizing an old woman for\n",
      "a guy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Sapskull and myself, with Thomas Hardy and half a dozen other boys, met with\n",
      "a view to talk about the intended exploit. We withdrew to the backyard of the schoolroom, and\n",
      "there, in a corner where we thought we could not be overheard, we began to plot against the\n",
      "liberty of Dame Clackett.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardy was one of the rarest boys for making fireworks I ever knew in my life. He had bought\n",
      "a book called \"Every Boy his own Squib-Maker,\" in which were directions for making squibs,\n",
      "crackers, rockets, Roman candles, serpents, slow fire, blue lights, and other descriptions\n",
      "of fireworks. This he nearly knew by heart. Sapskull said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look in your book and see if there is not in it how to make a guy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Hardy looked all over the book, but to no purpose; there was no description of a guy manufactory.\n",
      "It was of no consequence; we had a guy in our head, and we only now wished to know how we should\n",
      "get hold of the old lady, and what we should do on this joyful occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardy said he had several pounds of gunpowder, and would sell us all squibs and crackers. But\n",
      "these we did not so much want. What we wanted was an old chair, an old jacket, hat, and other\n",
      "matters to dress up the old lady when we could catch her. But how to get her into the chair\n",
      "was the difficulty, and some proposed one thing and some another. Sapskull said, \"We must make\n",
      "her merry with some beer.\" Hardy said, \"We must tie her down.\" But I proposed to ask her to\n",
      "sit for her picture as a guy, and then to carry her off. Master Quidd was, however, more cunning\n",
      "than any of us, and said, \"I know how to nab her; I have a plan, and a capital one it is, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it? what is it?\" said all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact was old Dame Clackett was a very staunch churchwoman, and used always to go both on\n",
      "Wednesdays and Fridays, Rain or sunshine, hot or cold, nothing could keep her away from her\n",
      "church, and we silly boys laughed at her for it. Poor old creature! she felt more real pleasure\n",
      "in this than we could imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you what we will do,\" said Quidd. \"There is in our outhouse an old wheeled chair\n",
      "which my mother used to ride about in when she was so long ill, a year or two ago. Now, I know\n",
      "old Dame Clackett is very lame just now, from having let fall her fender on her foot. I will\n",
      "take this chair down, and offer to draw her to church in it, and then, when we have once got\n",
      "her in the chair, we can do as we like with her. Hurrah!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't that be fun?\" continued Quidd. \"Let us do it--let us do it. There is no law against\n",
      "it; the thing was never thought of. It is just like the law that was never made among the Romans\n",
      "that I read about in my lessons yesterday: there was no law against a child killing his own\n",
      "father. I tell you,\" said he, \"if there were twenty old women to be seized and burnt, nobody\n",
      "could be hurt for it. But you do not mean to burn her, I suppose, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no,\" said we; \"we only want to have some fun. We should like to make a guy of her, that\n",
      "is all, and rare fun it will be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me join you,\" said one; \"Let me join,\" said another, till at last the whole school entered\n",
      "into the plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all forgot what we should have remembered--namely, that, instead of despising or ridiculing\n",
      "people who are old and helpless and poor, we ought to treat them with kindness, respect, and\n",
      "consideration. We forgot that we, if suffered to live long enough, should also become old,\n",
      "and that it would be hard for us to bear the coldness and neglect of the world, but much harder\n",
      "to endure the ridicule and ill-behavior of wicked children. Ay, we were thoughtless lads, and\n",
      "so we suffered for it, as you will afterwards hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady whom I had seen sitting in the church porch, who was so ugly, as I thought, and\n",
      "so withered and old, was a very poor widow. Her husband had died in battle long ago, and she\n",
      "had from year to year supported herself by her spinning wheel and the little relief she had\n",
      "from the parish. She lived in a little hut on a piece of waste ground, and kept a little poultry,\n",
      "and now and then a pig or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other animals, the old lady kept an enormous goat, or, rather, he kept himself. It was\n",
      "one her husband had brought her from abroad, of the Syrian breed. It was quite young when it\n",
      "came over, but at last grew and grew so, as to become a very formidable animal, so strong and\n",
      "fierce, that every dog was afraid of it, being, no doubt, terrified by the sight of its large\n",
      "horns and undaunted aspect. The name of this dread animal was Hannibal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor old Goody Clackett--for that was her name--had little thoughts of ever being \"smugged,\"\n",
      "as it was termed, by our schoolfellows to make a guy on the fifth of November, and sat quietly\n",
      "enough spinning her wheel and drawing out her yarn. Sometimes the thrum of the old wheel would\n",
      "send her soundly to sleep, and then she never dreamed of such a thing as was to happen to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every boy was delighted with this proposition, and it was arranged that on the following evening\n",
      "I and my cousin Simon should assist in the endeavor to get the chair from the outhouse to a\n",
      "convenient place, while Hardy was to provide lantern, matches, cap, and feathers, with red\n",
      "and black paint to disfigure the features of the poor old creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will make her amends,\" said Quidd, \"all the money we get shall be hers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes; that is quite fair,\" said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the evening came and it was quite dark, Simon and I went to the back part of Quidd's father's\n",
      "house. After waiting some little time we heard a knock. Presently Quidd opened the gates and\n",
      "came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, get it,\" said he. \"Look about to see if anybody is coming, and you can take it away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We did so. The coast was clear, and out rolled the chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simon and I took hold of it, one behind and one before at the handle-stick. Away we went, as\n",
      "had been preconcerted between us in the stable-yard of another schoolfellow of ours in the\n",
      "plot, who placed it near the gate and covered it over with loose straw, so that no one could\n",
      "see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next evening, which was the fourth of November, we met again by appointment at the dark\n",
      "hollow of the churchyard. This meeting was for the purpose of determining about the way in\n",
      "which Dame Clackett should be dressed in her triumphal entry to the Town Hall, the place where\n",
      "the bonfires were usually made. Hardy had brought what was of essential service--namely, an\n",
      "old coat which had formerly belonged to his father when in the yeomanry cavalry, an old helmet,\n",
      "a cartridge-box, and a pair of boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall never get the boots on,\" said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another boy brought an old lantern with the horn burnt out, a third a bunch of matches; then\n",
      "there was a mask and a lath-sword and a drum, with sticks and straw in abundance. They were\n",
      "all deposited in the same place with the chair. The conspirators (for conspirators we were)\n",
      "then made a promise to each other not to split, as they call it--that is, not to betray each\n",
      "other, and to go through with our work like Britons; so we all shook hands and parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning was a holiday, and we were up betimes. After a consultation it was determined\n",
      "that I and Quidd should go to the old dame and see how she was, and if she was determined to\n",
      "go to church, and if there would be any difficulty to get her to accept of the convenience\n",
      "of our vehicle; so off we set. In less than half-an-hour we reached the old dame's cottage,\n",
      "and found her at that very moment dressing her foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quidd was the first who spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, Goody,\" said he. \"What, is not your foot well yet? Why, I hear you have not\n",
      "been to church lately. The curate was at father's last night, and said if you were so lame\n",
      "that you could not walk, you might have our easy four-wheeled chair. But I suppose you won't\n",
      "go to church to-day--it is only the fifth of November?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not go to church!\" said the old woman--\"not go to church! I have always gone on the fifth\n",
      "of November for forty years. My poor husband was in a French prison, and he knew well enough\n",
      "what the Jacobites are. Was he not blown up, poor fellow, in the 'Glorious?' and were not King\n",
      "James and all his people to have been blown up so high by the horrid Papist plot that I suppose\n",
      "they would not have been down by this time? No Popery, I say! I would sooner crawl to church\n",
      "on my hands and knees than not go to-day, young gentlemen. And then Mr. Hassock, the kind,\n",
      "good curate, to ask for me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and then there is the 'coal money' given on the fifth, that all the widows in the parish\n",
      "may have a good fire through the winter, you know, Goody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I must go to church,\" said Mrs. Clackett.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you must,\" said Quidd, \"and I will tell you what these young gentlemen and I will do.\n",
      "We will bring down the chair, and take you there ourselves. I am sure it would please Mr. Hassock.\n",
      "Would it not, Parley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and the rector also,\" said I. \"And I have no doubt but the churchwardens would like to\n",
      "see Goody at church, for the tickets for flannel petticoats are to be given away to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\" said Mrs. Clackett. \"Oh, yes, I could not keep away from my church! Good young\n",
      "gentlemen, I shall never forget your kindness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped to hear no more. We were overjoyed with the success of our plot. Away we ran to\n",
      "our companions, and, without stopping to explain, cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The chair! the chair! We shall have a guy, the best in the whole country!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So away we ran with the chair, and all our other preparations for dressing and tying and securing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole party surrounded the chair, some pushing, some pulling. When, however, we got within\n",
      "a convenient distance of the old lady's hut, Hardy and the others stepped on one side, and\n",
      "placed the helmet, coat, lantern, matches, etc., under a hedge, to be ready when required,\n",
      "while Quidd, Sapskull, and myself went with the chair to the old lady's cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got there we found her spruce and prim with her best black silk bonnet, something in\n",
      "shape like a coal-scuttle, her stick in her hand, and her shoes on her feet. We drove up the\n",
      "chair in fine style. There were several cottages close by, and the neighbors came out to see\n",
      "the old lady ride. At last some one who knew Quidd said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that is the lawyer's son. Sure enough old Goody has got some money left her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So then there was a talking and surmising, and before Goody got to church it was reported all\n",
      "over the town that she was made the possessor of several thousand pounds prize-money; that\n",
      "she was to be a lady, and ride in her carriage. Being sent for, as it was supposed, by the\n",
      "lawyer must be for something--a large legacy, no doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair wheeled on with Goody in it. The boys looked as if they were up to something, and\n",
      "sure enough they were. When they came to that part of the lane at which the various habiliments\n",
      "had been left, the chair stopped, and out rushed the other conspirators.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not be alarmed, Goody,\" said Hardy. \"We are only going to make a guy of you for an hour\n",
      "or two. No one shall harm you, and you shall have all the money we get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to go to church--I want to go to church!\" said the old lady, and tried to get out of\n",
      "the chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardy, however, very dexterously threw some cord round the arms, and tied the poor old creature\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We won't hurt you, Goody,\" said he. \"We only want you for a guy. You shall have all the money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't be a guy! I won't be a guy!\" said Goody. \"I do not want any money. Let me out! let\n",
      "me out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then made a blow with her broomstick, and struck Master Hardy on the nose, from which the\n",
      "blood flowed freely. This, however, only made him the more determined, and in a few minutes\n",
      "the poor old woman's arms were secured as well as her legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, help, neighbors! They are going to burn me!\" said the old lady, and then she fell coughing,\n",
      "for she had long suffered from asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "While convulsed with this fit, the boys took the opportunity to besmear her face with red and\n",
      "black paint, and to place the helmet on her head, and the coat round her, so that the arms\n",
      "hung on each side with nothing on them. The chair was then crammed with straw, and the lantern\n",
      "and the matches suspended from it. In this state the chair was wheeled rapidly along in the\n",
      "direction of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other boys soon joined, and surrounded the vehicle, shouting and laughing. The old lady, made\n",
      "several ineffectual attempts to get out of the chair. She called out, \"A plot! a plot! a Popery\n",
      "plot! No Popery! Oh! I shall be killed!\" and many such exclamations. The populace took this\n",
      "as a part of the character, and laughed most heartily. The greatest number of persons thought\n",
      "the guy to be a boy dressed up, and cried out that he acted his part well. No one suspected\n",
      "it was old Dame Clackett.\n",
      "\n",
      "Away they went in the midst of the hubbub, up one street and down another, over the market-place\n",
      "and by the church. Just as the clock struck twelve the boys of the Free School came from the\n",
      "latter place, and joined the procession. It was now a national affair, and, as it proceeded\n",
      "from the church doors, it was thought to be the church Guy Fawkes--and so it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted a hundred voices; and while Hardy and his companions held on the\n",
      "chair, Quidd and I went about with our hats to collect as much money as we could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady was vociferous, and struggled to get out. She flung her arms about, and cried\n",
      "out, \"Deliver me from the flames! Save me from being burnt!\" and everybody thought that the\n",
      "part of guy was acted to perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quidd and I got a great deal of money--silver, and copper, and even gold. Seven-shilling pieces\n",
      "were in circulation at that time, and the squire and Mr. Hassock passing us, one threw sixpence\n",
      "and the other a seven-shilling piece to us, for which we gave a louder cheer than usual. In\n",
      "short, our hats were very nearly half full of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman began to be more pacified as she saw the money coming in, particularly as we\n",
      "put it all into her lap, and told her it should be hers. But the sight of the squire and the\n",
      "curate, and the seven-shilling piece, which latter we put into her mouth, seemed quite to reconcile\n",
      "her to her fate. She became then as gentle as a lamb. She said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do as you like--do as you like, only don't burn me for a guy; and give me a drop of something\n",
      "to drink.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" said Quidd, \"here is something for you. Hold up your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And half a pint of good strong ale soon found its way down the throat of the dame. After this\n",
      "the chair again moved on, till at last it came to the market-place, opposite the Town Hall,\n",
      "where an enormous bonfire was in preparation, over which stood a gallows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady, when she saw the gallows, screamed \"Murder! fire! brimstone!\" and all sorts of\n",
      "horrid cries; but nobody took any heed of it, except to laugh. They thought it was in keeping\n",
      "with her character.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will not hurt you, we will not hurt you,\" said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was of no use; the old lady refused to be pacified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Quidd felt a severe blow from behind, which sent him sprawling. I also\n",
      "received a push or a drive, and a loud laugh burst from those around.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I turned to see what was the cause of the laughter, what should I observe but Hannibal,\n",
      "the goat, who had, it appeared, followed his mistress, and, being excited by her cries, dashed\n",
      "at my schoolfellow in the way described. Several of the spectators now tried to seize the goat,\n",
      "but he being of extraordinary strength, butted and pushed so vigorously that several measured\n",
      "their length upon the earth, to the no small merriment of the clownish persons who had collected\n",
      "together to the burning of the guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "During all this time Dame Clackett cried out loudly, and in the confusion her chair was upset,\n",
      "and she became liberated from her duress. As soon as she was free, she laid about on all sides\n",
      "of her with her stick, pulled off the helmet and jacket in which she had been nearly smothered,\n",
      "and cried out at the top of her voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am no guy! I am Dame Clackett! For goodness' sake do not burn me for a witch!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She, however, kept her apron close in which the money was, and took care not to let the seven-shilling\n",
      "piece fall out of her mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mob cheered. It would have been well if this had been all, but no: as soon as ever the\n",
      "old lady told her story that she had been seized for a guy, an effort was immediately made\n",
      "to secure the offenders. The constable, who happened to be present, laid hold of me and cousin\n",
      "Simon; several others were seized by the bystanders; and the whole, with the exception of Quidd,\n",
      "were dragged off to what in the country is called the goose-house--that is, the cage. Quidd,\n",
      "lawyer-like, contrived to get out of the scrape, leaving others in it. So we were all put into\n",
      "the cage, and bolted and barred. It was very dark, and as we were terribly frightened, we all\n",
      "began to howl most hideously.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Quidd, he went homewards, as if nothing had happened, and soon made his reappearance,\n",
      "prepared for the usual squibbing and cracking, with his pockets full of squibs and crackers.\n",
      "He was so pleased with the success of the scheme in which he had been so forward an actor that\n",
      "he determined to have more fun before he went to bed; so he looked about, and it was not long\n",
      "before he saw a fit object, as he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the corner of the street leading to the market-place sat poor old Hannah Grimly, as she\n",
      "was called. She had sold roasted chestnuts on the fifth of November for a score of years, and\n",
      "many a pinch of gunpowder had been put under the lid of the saucepan upon which the chestnuts\n",
      "were laid. Quidd determined to have a good explosion, and took the opportunity, while the chestnuts\n",
      "were being put into his hand, to introduce a packet of gunpowder into the kettle. He thought\n",
      "to run away before it should ignite, but there being a small hole in the paper, the moment\n",
      "it touched the fire the whole went off with a loud explosion. Quidd's hand was shattered to\n",
      "pieces, and he fell stunned with the effects of the powder. He was taken home senseless, and\n",
      "put to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the conspirators, including myself, were kept in the cage all night in bitter tears.\n",
      "The next morning we were taken before the magistrates. The chairman, who happened to be the\n",
      "very squire who had given us the seven-shilling piece, looked very severely at us, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the most horrible plot I ever heard of--seizing an old woman for a guy! Gentlemen,\"\n",
      "said he to those around him, \"if this be permitted none of us are safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people used to call the magistrates old women, and so this raised a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then called to the clerk to look over the Act of Parliament to see what could be the punishment\n",
      "for such an offence, but found none. Quidd was right--there was no law against seizing an old\n",
      "woman for a guy. The bench were puzzled what to do. At last Quidd's father said we should be\n",
      "indicted for stealing his chair, and be put on our trial for robbery and sacrilege--the first\n",
      "for the abduction of the chair, the second for keeping the old lady from church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our fathers and mothers, however, pleaded so eloquently that, after a severe admonition, we\n",
      "got off upon payment of the costs and a handsome compensation to Dame Clackett. When I reached\n",
      "home my father took me into the stable and gave me a sound whipping, and at the conclusion\n",
      "of the flagellation said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Peter Parley, I think you will not again seize an old woman for a guy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And I never did. Lessons were then considered rather a plague, sugar-plums were still in demand,\n",
      "holidays continued yet in fashion, and toys were not then made to teach mathematics, nor storybooks\n",
      "to give instruction in chemistry and navigation. These were very strange times, and there existed\n",
      "at that period a very idle, greedy, naughty boy, such as we never hear of in the present day.\n",
      "His father and mother were--no matter who, and he lived--no matter where. His name was Master\n",
      "No-book, and he seemed to think his eyes were made for nothing but to stare out of the windows,\n",
      "and his mouth for no other purpose but to eat. This young gentleman hated lessons like mustard,\n",
      "both of which brought tears into his eyes, and during school hours he sat gazing at his books,\n",
      "pretending to be busy, while his mind wandered away to wish impatiently for dinner, and to\n",
      "consider where he could get the nicest pies, pastry, ices, and jellies, while he smacked his\n",
      "lips at the very thoughts of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever Master No-book spoke it was always to ask for something, and you might continually\n",
      "hear him say in a whining tone of voice: \"Father, may I take this piece of cake?\" \"Aunt Sarah,\n",
      "will you give me an apple?\" \"Mother, do send me the whole of that plum-pudding.\" Indeed, very\n",
      "frequently, when he did not get permission to gormandize, this naughty glutton helped himself\n",
      "without leave. Even his dreams were like his waking hours, for he had often a horrible nightmare\n",
      "about lessons, thinking he was smothered with Greek lexicons or pelted out of the school with\n",
      "a shower of English grammars, while one night he fancied himself sitting down to devour an\n",
      "enormous plum-cake, and all on a sudden it became transformed into a Latin dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon Master No-book, having played truant all day from school, was lolling on his\n",
      "mother's best sofa in the drawing-room, with his leather boots tucked up on the satin cushions,\n",
      "and nothing to do but to suck a few oranges, and nothing to think of but how much sugar to\n",
      "put upon them, when suddenly an event took place which filled him with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming louder and louder the longer he listened,\n",
      "till at length, in a few moments afterwards, a large hole burst open in the wall of his room,\n",
      "and there stepped into his presence two magnificent fairies, just arrived from their castles\n",
      "in the air, to pay him a visit. They had traveled all the way on purpose to have some conversation\n",
      "with Master No-book, and immediately introduced themselves in a very ceremonious manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fairy Do-nothing was gorgeously dressed with a wreath of flaming gas round her head, a\n",
      "robe of gold tissue, a necklace of rubies, and a bouquet in her hand of glittering diamonds.\n",
      "Her cheeks were rouged to the very eyes, her teeth were set in gold, and her hair was of a\n",
      "most brilliant purple; in short, so fine and fashionable-looking a fairy never was seen in\n",
      "a drawing-room before. The fairy Teach-all, who followed next, was simply dressed in white\n",
      "muslin, with bunches of natural flowers in her light-brown hair, and she carried in her hand\n",
      "a few neat small volumes, which Master No-book looked at with a shudder of aversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two fairies now informed him that they very often invited large parties of children to\n",
      "spend some time at their palaces, but as they lived in quite an opposite direction, it was\n",
      "necessary for their young guests to choose which it would be best to visit first; therefore\n",
      "they had now come to inquire of Master No-book whom he thought it would be most agreeable to\n",
      "accompany on the present occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In my house,\" said the fairy Teach-all, speaking with a very sweet smile and a soft, pleasing\n",
      "voice, \"you shall be taught to find pleasure in every sort of exertion, for I delight in activity\n",
      "and diligence. My young friends rise at seven every morning, and amuse themselves with working\n",
      "in a beautiful garden of flowers, rearing whatever fruit they wish to eat, visiting among the\n",
      "poor, associating pleasantly together, studying the arts and sciences, and learning to know\n",
      "the world in which they live, and to fulfil the purposes for which they have been brought into\n",
      "it. In short, all our amusements tend to some useful object, either for our own improvement\n",
      "or the good of others, and you will grow wiser, better, and happier every day you remain in\n",
      "the palace of Knowledge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But in Castle Needless, where I live,\" interrupted the fairy Do-nothing, rudely pushing her\n",
      "companion aside with an angry, contemptuous look, \"we never think of exerting ourselves for\n",
      "anything. You may put your head in your pocket and your hands in your sides as long as you\n",
      "choose to stay. No one is ever asked a question, that he may be spared the trouble of answering.\n",
      "We lead the most fashionable life imaginable, for nobody speaks to anybody. Each of my visitors\n",
      "is quite an exclusive, and sits with his back to as many of the company as possible, in the\n",
      "most comfortable arm-chair that can be contrived. There, if you are only so good as to take\n",
      "the trouble of wishing for anything, it is yours without even turning an eye round to look\n",
      "where it comes from. Dresses are provided of the most magnificent kind, which go on themselves,\n",
      "without your having the smallest annoyance with either buttons or strings; games which you\n",
      "can play without an effort of thought; and dishes dressed by a French cook, smoking hot under\n",
      "your nose, from morning till night; while any rain we have is either made of lemonade or lavender-water,\n",
      "and in winter it generally snows iced punch for an hour during the forenoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody need be told which fairy Master No-book preferred, and quite charmed at his own good\n",
      "fortune in receiving so agreeable an invitation, he eagerly gave his hand to the splendid new\n",
      "acquaintance who promised him so much pleasure and ease, and gladly proceeded in a carriage\n",
      "lined with velvet, stuffed with downy pillows, and drawn by milk-white swans, to that magnificent\n",
      "residence, Castle Needless, which was lighted by a thousand windows during the day, and by\n",
      "a million of lamps every night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Master No-book enjoyed a constant holiday and a constant feast, while a beautiful lady\n",
      "covered with jewels was ready to tell him stories from morning till night, and servants waited\n",
      "to pick up his playthings if they fell, or to draw out his purse or his pocket-handkerchief\n",
      "when he wished to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Master No-book lay dozing for hours and days on rich embroidered cushions, never stirring\n",
      "from his place, but admiring the view of trees covered with the richest burnt almonds, grottoes\n",
      "of sugar-candy, a jet d'eau of champagne, a wide sea which tasted of sugar instead of salt,\n",
      "and a bright, clear pond, filled with gold fish that let themselves be caught whenever he pleased.\n",
      "Nothing could be more complete, and yet, very strange to say, Master No-book did not seem particularly\n",
      "happy. This appears exceedingly unreasonable, when so much trouble was taken to please him;\n",
      "but the truth is that every day he became more fretful and peevish. No sweetmeats were worth\n",
      "the trouble of eating, nothing was pleasant to play at, and in the end he wished it were possible\n",
      "to sleep all day, as well as all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a hundred miles from the fairy Do-nothing's palace there lived a most cruel monster called\n",
      "the giant Snap-'em-up, who looked, when he stood up, like the tall steeple of a great church,\n",
      "raising his head so high that he could peep over the loftiest mountains, and was obliged to\n",
      "climb up a ladder to comb his own hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning regularly this prodigiously great giant walked round the world before breakfast\n",
      "for an appetite, after which he made tea in a large lake, used the sea as a slop-basin, and\n",
      "boiled his kettle on Mount Vesuvius. He lived in great style, and his dinners were most magnificent,\n",
      "consisting very often of an elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties, a tiger smothered in onions,\n",
      "stewed lions, and whale soup; but for a side-dish his greatest favorite consisted of little\n",
      "boys, as fat as possible, fried in crumbs of bread, with plenty of pepper and salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "No children were so well fed or in such good condition for eating as those in the fairy Do-nothing's\n",
      "garden, who was a very particular friend of the giant Snap-'em-up's, and who sometimes laughingly\n",
      "said she would give him a license, and call her own garden his \"preserve,\" because she always\n",
      "allowed him to help himself, whenever he pleased, to as many of her visitors as he chose, without\n",
      "taking the trouble to even count them; and in return for such extreme civility, the giant very\n",
      "frequently invited her to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snap-'em-up's favorite sport was to see how many brace of little boys he could bag in a morning;\n",
      "so, in passing along the streets, he peeped into all the drawing-rooms, without having occasion\n",
      "to get upon tiptoe, and picked up every young gentleman who was idly looking out of the windows,\n",
      "and even a few occasionally who were playing truant from school; but busy children seemed always\n",
      "somehow quite out of his reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, when Master No-book felt even more lazy, more idle, and more miserable than ever,\n",
      "he lay beside a perfect mountain of toys and cakes, wondering what to wish for next, and hating\n",
      "the very sight of everything and everybody. At last he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and\n",
      "disgust that his jaw very nearly fell out of joint, and then he sighed so deeply that the giant\n",
      "Snap-'em-up heard the sound as he passed along the road after breakfast, and instantly stepped\n",
      "into the garden, with his glass at his eye, to see what was the matter. Immediately, on observing\n",
      "a large, fat, overgrown boy, as round as a dumpling, lying on a bed of roses, he gave a cry\n",
      "of delight, followed by a gigantic peal of laughter, which was heard three miles off, and picking\n",
      "up Master No-book between his finger and thumb, with a pinch that very nearly broke his ribs,\n",
      "he carried him rapidly towards his own castle, while the fairy Do-nothing laughingly shook\n",
      "her head as he passed, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That little man does me great credit. He has only been fed for a week, and is as fat already\n",
      "as a prize ox. What a dainty morsel he will be! When do you dine to-day, in case I should have\n",
      "time to look in upon you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching home the giant immediately hung up Master No-book by the hair of his head, on a\n",
      "prodigious hook in the larder, having first taken some large lumps of nasty suet, forcing them\n",
      "down his throat to make him become still fatter, and then stirring the fire, that he might\n",
      "be almost melted with heat, to make his liver grow larger. On a shelf quite near Master No-book\n",
      "perceived the bodies of six other boys, whom he remembered to have seen fattening in the fairy\n",
      "Do-nothing's garden, while he recollected how some of them had rejoiced at the thoughts of\n",
      "leading a long, useless, idle life, with no one to please but themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enormous cook now seized hold of Master No-book, brandishing her knife with an aspect of\n",
      "horrible determination, intending to kill him, while he took the trouble of screaming and kicking\n",
      "in the most desperate manner, when the giant turned gravely round, and said that, as pigs were\n",
      "considered a much greater dainty when whipped to death than killed in any other way, he meant\n",
      "to see whether children might not be improved by it also; therefore she might leave that great\n",
      "hog of a boy till he had time to try the experiment, especially as his own appetite would be\n",
      "improved by the exercise. This was a dreadful prospect for the unhappy prisoner, but meantime\n",
      "it prolonged his life a few hours, as he was immediately hung up in the larder and left to\n",
      "himself. There, in torture of mind and body, like a fish upon a hook, the wretched boy began\n",
      "at last to reflect seriously upon his former ways, and to consider what a happy home he might\n",
      "have had, if he could only have been satisfied with business and pleasure succeeding each other,\n",
      "like day and night, while lessons might have come in as a pleasant sauce to his play-hours,\n",
      "and his play-hours as a sauce to his lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of many reflections, which were all very sensible, though rather too late, Master\n",
      "No-book's attention became attracted by the sound of many voices laughing, talking, and singing,\n",
      "which caused him to turn his eyes in a new direction, when, for the first time, he observed\n",
      "that the fairy Teach-all's garden lay upon a beautiful sloping bank not far off. There a crowd\n",
      "of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked boys were busily employed, and seemed happier than the day was\n",
      "long, while poor Master No-book watched them during his own miserable hours, envying the enjoyment\n",
      "with which they raked the flower-borders, gathered the fruit, carried baskets of vegetables\n",
      "to the poor, worked with carpenter's tools, drew pictures, shot with bows-and-arrows, played\n",
      "at cricket, and then sat in the sunny arbors learning their tasks, or talking agreeably together,\n",
      "till at length, a dinner-bell having been rung, the whole party sat merrily down with hearty\n",
      "appetites and cheerful good humor, to an entertainment of plain roast meat and pudding, where\n",
      "the fairy Teach-all presided herself, and helped her guests moderately to as much as was good\n",
      "for each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large tears rolled down the cheeks of Master No-book while watching this scene, and remembering\n",
      "that if he had known what was best for him, he might have been as happy as the happiest of\n",
      "these excellent boys, instead of suffering ennui and weariness, as he had done at the fairy\n",
      "Do-nothing's, ending in a miserable death. But his attention was soon after most alarmingly\n",
      "roused by hearing the giant Snap-'em-up again in conversation with his cook, who said that,\n",
      "if he wished for a good large dish of scolloped children at dinner, it would be necessary to\n",
      "catch a few more, as those he had already provided would scarcely be a mouthful.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the giant kept very fashionable hours, and always waited dinner for himself till nine o'clock,\n",
      "there was still plenty of time; so, with a loud grumble about the trouble, he seized a large\n",
      "basket in his hand, and set off at a rapid pace towards the fairy Teach-all's garden. It was\n",
      "very seldom that Snap-'em-up ventured to think of foraging in this direction, as he never once\n",
      "succeeded in carrying off a single captive from the enclosure, it was so well fortified and\n",
      "so bravely defended; but on this occasion, being desperately hungry, he felt as bold as a lion,\n",
      "and walked, with outstretched hands, straight towards the fairy Teach-all's dinner-table, taking\n",
      "such prodigious strides that he seemed almost as if he would trample on himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cry of consternation arose the instant this tremendous giant appeared, and, as usual on such\n",
      "occasions, when he had made the same attempt before, a dreadful battle took place. Fifty active\n",
      "little boys bravely flew upon the enemy, armed with their dinner-knives, and looked like a\n",
      "nest of hornets, stinging him in every direction, till he roared with pain, and would have\n",
      "run away; but the fairy Teach-all, seeing his intention, rushed forward with the carving-knife,\n",
      "and brandishing it high over her head, she most courageously stabbed him to the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a great mountain had fallen to the earth it would have seemed like nothing in comparison\n",
      "with the giant Snap-em-up, who crushed two or three houses to powder beneath him, and upset\n",
      "several fine monuments that were to have made people remembered for ever. But all this would\n",
      "have seemed scarcely worth mentioning had it not been for a still greater event which occurred\n",
      "on the occasion, no less than the death of the fairy Do-nothing, who had been indolently looking\n",
      "on at this great battle without taking the trouble to interfere, or even to care who was victorious;\n",
      "but being also lazy about running away, when the giant fell, his sword came with so violent\n",
      "a stroke on her head that she instantly expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, luckily for the whole world, the fairy Teach-all got possession of immense property,\n",
      "which she proceeded without delay to make the best use of in her power.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, however, she lost no time in liberating Master No-book from his hook in\n",
      "the larder, and gave him a lecture on activity, moderation, and good conduct, which he never\n",
      "afterwards forgot; and it was astonishing to see the change that took place immediately in\n",
      "his whole thoughts and actions. From this very hour Master No-book became the most diligent,\n",
      "active, happy boy in the fairy Teach-all's garden; and on returning home a month afterwards,\n",
      "he astonished all the masters at school by his extraordinary reformation. The most difficult\n",
      "lessons were a pleasure to him, he scarcely ever stirred without a book in his hand, never\n",
      "lay on a sofa again, would scarcely even sit on a chair with a back to it, but preferred a\n",
      "three-legged stool, detested holidays, never thought any exertion a trouble, preferred climbing\n",
      "over the top of a hill to creeping round the bottom, always ate the plainest food in very small\n",
      "quantities, joined a temperance society, and never tasted a morsel till he had worked very\n",
      "hard and got an appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after this an old uncle, who had formerly been ashamed of Master No-book's indolence\n",
      "and gluttony, became so pleased at the wonderful change that on his death he left him a magnificent\n",
      "estate, desiring that he should take his name; therefore, instead of being any longer one of\n",
      "the No-book family, he is now called Sir Timothy Blue-stocking, a pattern to the whole country\n",
      "around for the good he does to everyone, and especially for his extraordinary activity, appearing\n",
      "as if he could do twenty things at once. Though generally very good-natured and agreeable,\n",
      "Sir Timothy is occasionally observed in a violent passion, laying about him with his walking-stick\n",
      "in the most terrific manner, and beating little boys within an inch of their lives; but on\n",
      "inquiry it invariably appears that he has found them out to be lazy, idle, or greedy; for all\n",
      "the industrious boys in the parish are sent to get employment from him, while he assures them\n",
      "that they are far happier breaking stones on the road than if they were sitting idly in a drawing-room\n",
      "with nothing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE INQUISITIVE GIRL\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Hammond was a physician in great practice in the West of England. He resided in a small\n",
      "market-town and his family consisted of one son, named Charles, and two daughters, Louisa and\n",
      "Sophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophy possessed many amiable qualities, and did not want for sense, but every better feeling\n",
      "was lost in her extreme inquisitiveness. Her faculties were all occupied in peeping and prying\n",
      "about, and, provided she could gratify her own curiosity, she never cared how much vexation\n",
      "she caused to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "This propensity began when she was so very young that it had become a habit before her parents\n",
      "perceived it. She was a very little creature when she was once nearly squeezed to death between\n",
      "two double doors as she was peeping through the keyhole of one of them to see who was in the\n",
      "drawing-room; and another time she was locked up for several hours in a closet in which she\n",
      "had hid herself for the purpose of overhearing what her mother was saying to one of the servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sophy was eleven and her sister about sixteen years old their mother died. Louisa was\n",
      "placed at the head of her father's house, and the superintendence of Sophy's education necessarily\n",
      "devolved on her. The care of such a family was a great charge for a young person of Miss Hammond's\n",
      "age, and more especially as her father was obliged to be so much from home that she could not\n",
      "always have his counsel and advice even when she most needed it. By this means she fell into\n",
      "an injudicious mode of treating her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Louisa received a note she carefully locked it up, and never spoke of its contents before\n",
      "Sophy. If a message was brought to her she always went out of the room to receive it, and never\n",
      "suffered the servant to speak in her sister's hearing. When any visitors came Louisa commonly\n",
      "sent Sophy out of the room, or if they were intimate friends she would converse with them in\n",
      "whispers; in short, it was her chief study that everything which passed in the family should\n",
      "be a secret from Sophy. Alas! this procedure, instead of repressing Sophy's curiosity, only\n",
      "made it the more keen; her eyes and ears were always on the alert, and what she could not see,\n",
      "hear, or thoroughly comprehend she made out by guesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst consequence of Louisa's conduct was that as Sophy had no friend and companion in\n",
      "her sister, who treated her with such constant suspicion and reserve, she necessarily was induced\n",
      "to find a friend and companion among the servants, and she selected the housemaid Sally, a\n",
      "good-natured, well-intentioned girl, but silly and ignorant and inquisitive like herself, and\n",
      "it may be easily supposed how much mischief these two foolish creatures occasioned, not only\n",
      "in the family, but also among their neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened soon after, that for an offence which was the cause of very great vexation to her\n",
      "brother, and was the occasion of his being for a time deprived of the friendship of Sir Henry\n",
      "and Lady Askham, two of Dr. Hammond's nearest and most intimate neighbors, her father ordered\n",
      "Sophy, as a still further punishment, to be locked up in her own room till the Sunday following.\n",
      "This was on Friday, and Sophy had two days of solitude and imprisonment before her. The first\n",
      "day she passed very dismally, but yet not unprofitably, for she felt truly ashamed and sorry\n",
      "for her fault, and made many good resolutions of endeavoring to cure herself of her mischievous\n",
      "propensity. The second day she began to be somewhat more composed, and by degrees she was able\n",
      "to amuse herself with watching the people in the street, which was overlooked by the windows\n",
      "of her apartment, and she began, almost unconsciously to herself, to indulge in her old habit\n",
      "of trying to find out what everybody was doing, and in guessing where they were going.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not long been engaged in watching her neighbors before her curiosity was excited by\n",
      "the appearance of a servant on horseback, who rode up to the door, and, after giving a little\n",
      "three-cornered note to Dr. Hammond's footman, rode off. The servant she knew to be Mrs. Arden's,\n",
      "an intimate friend of her father, and the note she conjectured was an invitation to dinner,\n",
      "and the guessing what day the invitation was for, and who were to be the company, and whether\n",
      "she was included in the invitation, was occupying her busy fancy, when she saw her sister going\n",
      "out of the house with the three-cornered note in her hand, and cross the street to Mr. McNeal's\n",
      "stocking shop, which was opposite. Almost immediately afterwards Mr. McNeal's shopman came\n",
      "out of the shop, and, running down the street, was presently out of sight, but soon returned\n",
      "with Mr. McNeal himself. She saw Louisa reading the note to Mr. McNeal, and in a few minutes\n",
      "afterwards return home. Here was a matter of wonder and conjecture. Sophy forgot all her good\n",
      "resolutions, and absolutely wearied herself with her useless curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the term of her imprisonment was over, and Sophy was restored to the society of her\n",
      "family. At first she kept a tolerable guard over herself. Once she saw her father and sister\n",
      "whispering, and did not, though she longed much to do it, hold her breath that she might hear\n",
      "what they were saying. Another time she passed Charles's door when it was ajar and the little\n",
      "study open, and she had so much self-command that she passed by without peeping in, and she\n",
      "began to think she was cured of her faults. But in reality this was far from being the case,\n",
      "and whenever she recollected Mrs. Arden's mysterious note she felt her inquisitive propensities\n",
      "as strong as ever. Her eyes and ears were always on the alert, in hopes of obtaining some clue\n",
      "to the knowledge she coveted, and if Mrs, Arden's or Mr. McNeal's names were mentioned she\n",
      "listened with trembling anxiety in the hope of hearing some allusion to the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, when she had almost given up the matter in despair, an unlooked-for chance put her\n",
      "in possession of a fragment of this very note to which she attached so much importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Louisa wanted to wind a skein of silk, and in looking for a piece of paper to wind\n",
      "it upon she opened her writing-box, and took out Mrs. Arden's note. Sophy knew it again in\n",
      "an instant from its three-cornered shape. She saw her sister tear the note in two, throw one-half\n",
      "under the grate, and fold the other part up to wind her silk upon. Sophy kept her eye upon\n",
      "the paper that lay under the grate in the greatest anxiety, lest a coal should drop upon it\n",
      "and destroy it, when it seemed almost within her grasp. Louisa was called out of the room,\n",
      "and Sophy, overpowered by the greatness of the temptation, forgot all the good resolutions\n",
      "she had so lately made, and at the risk of setting fire to her sleeve, snatched the paper from\n",
      "among the ashes, and concealed it in her pocket. She then flew to her own room to examine it\n",
      "at her ease. The note had been torn the lengthway of the paper, and that part of it of which\n",
      "Sophy had possessed herself contained the first half of each line of the note. Bolting her\n",
      "door for fear of interruption, she read, with trembling impatience, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "        Will you\n",
      "  be kind enough to go to\n",
      "  Mr. McNeal, and tell him\n",
      "  he has made a great mistake\n",
      "  the last stockings he sent;\n",
      "  charging them as silk) he has cheated\n",
      "  of several pounds.--I am sorry to say\n",
      "  that he has behaved very ill\n",
      "  And Mr. Arden tells me that\n",
      "  it must end in his being hanged\n",

      "  but fear this will be the end\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sophy had read these broken sentences she fancied that she fully comprehended the purport\n",
      "of the whole note, and she now saw the reason of her sister's hastening to Mr. McNeal's immediately\n",
      "on the receipt of the note, and of the hurry in which he had been summoned back to his shop.\n",
      "It appeared very clear to her that he had defrauded Mrs. Arden of a considerable sum of money,\n",
      "and that he was no longer that honest tradesman he had been supposed. The weight of this important\n",
      "discovery quite overburdened her, and, forgetful of her past punishment, and regardless of\n",
      "future consequences, she imparted the surprising secret to Sally. Sally was not one who could\n",
      "keep such a piece of news to herself; it was therefore soon circulated through half the town\n",
      "that Mr. McNeal had defrauded Mrs. Arden, and that Mr. Arden declared he would have him hanged\n",
      "for it. Several persons in consequence avoided Mr. McNeal's shop, who saw his customers forsaking\n",
      "him without being able to know why they did so. Thus the conduct of this inconsiderate girl\n",
      "took away the good name of an honest tradesman, on no better foundation than her own idle conjectures,\n",
      "drawn from the torn fragments of a letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McNeal at length became informed of the injurious report that was circulated about him.\n",
      "He immediately went to Mrs. Arden to tell her of the report, and to ask her if any inadvertency\n",
      "of his own in regard to her dealings at his shop occasioned her speaking so disadvantageously\n",
      "of him. Mrs. Arden was much astonished at what he told her, as she might well be, and assured\n",
      "him that she had never either spoken of him or thought of him but as thoroughly an honorable\n",
      "and honest tradesman. Mrs. Arden was exceedingly hurt that her name should be attached to such\n",
      "a cruel calumny, and, on consulting with Sir Henry Askham, it was agreed that he and Mrs. Arden\n",
      "should make it their business to trace it back to its authors. They found no real difficulty\n",
      "in tracing it back to Sally, Dr. Hammond's servant. She was accordingly sent for to Mr. McNeal's,\n",
      "where Sir Henry Askham and Mr. Arden, with some other gentlemen, were assembled on this charitable\n",
      "investigation. Sally, on being questioned who had told her of the report, replied, without\n",
      "hesitation, that she had been told by Miss Sophy, who had seen all the particulars in Mrs.\n",
      "Arden's handwriting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arden was greatly astonished at hearing this assertion, and felt confident that the whole\n",
      "must have originated from some strange blunder. He and the other gentlemen immediately proceeded\n",
      "to Dr. Hammond's, and having explained their business to him, desired to see Sophy. She, on\n",
      "being asked, confirmed what Sally had said, adding that to satisfy them she could show them\n",
      "Mrs. Arden's own words, and she accordingly produced the fragment of the note. Miss Hammond,\n",
      "the instant she saw the paper recollected it again, and winding off the silk from the other\n",
      "half of Mrs. Arden's note, presented it to Mr. Arden, who, laying the two pieces of paper together\n",
      "read as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"MY DEAR MISS HAMMOND,--Will you as soon as you receive this\n",
      "     be kind enough to go to your opposite neighbor, Mr. McNeal,\n",
      "     and tell him I find by looking at his bill he has made a\n",
      "     great mistake as to the price of the last stockings he sent;\n",
      "     and it seems to me (by not charging them as silk) he has\n",
      "     cheated himself, as he'll see, of several pounds.--I am sorry\n",
      "     to say of our new dog, that he has behaved very ill and\n",
      "     worried two sheep, and Mr. Arden tells me he very much fears\n",
      "     it must end in his being hanged or he'll kill all the flock.\n",
      "     I am exceedingly grieved, for he is a noble animal, but fear\n",
      "     this will be the end of my poor dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I am, dear Louisa, yours truly\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"MARY ARDEN.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus by the fortunate preservation of the last half of the note the whole affair was cleared\n",
      "up, Mrs. Arden's character vindicated from the charge of being a defamer, and Mr. McNeal from\n",
      "all suspicion of dishonesty. And all their friends were pleased and satisfied. But how did\n",
      "Sophy feel? She did feel at last both remorse and humiliation. She had no one to blame but\n",
      "herself; she had no one to take her part, for even her father and her brother considered it\n",
      "due to public justice that she should make a public acknowledgment of her fault to Mr. McNeal,\n",
      "and to ask his pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUSY IDLENESS\n",
      "\n",
      "By JANE TAYLOR\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dawson being obliged to leave home for six weeks, her daughters, Charlotte and Caroline,\n",
      "received permission to employ the time of her absence as they pleased; that is, she did not\n",
      "require of them the usual strict attention to particular hours and particular studies, but\n",
      "allowed them to choose their own employments--only recommending them to make a good use of\n",
      "the license, and apprising them, that, on her return, she should require an exact account of\n",
      "the manner in which the interval had been employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carriage that conveyed their mother away was scarcely out of hearing, when Charlotte, delighted\n",
      "with her freedom, hastened upstairs to the schoolroom, where she looked around on books, globes,\n",
      "maps, drawings, to select some new employment for the morning. Long before she had decided\n",
      "upon any, her sister had quietly seated herself at her accustomed station, thinking that she\n",
      "could do nothing better than finish the French exercise she had begun the day before. Charlotte,\n",
      "however, declined attending to French that day, and after much indecision, and saying \"I have\n",
      "a great mind to\" three several times without finishing the sentence, she at last took down\n",
      "a volume of Cowper, and read in different parts for about half an hour. Then throwing it aside,\n",
      "she said she had a great mind to put the bookshelves in order--a business which she commenced\n",
      "with great spirit. But in the course of her laudable undertaking, she met with a manuscript\n",
      "in shorthand; whereupon she exclaimed to her sister, \"Caroline, don't you remember that old\n",
      "Mr. Henderson once promised he would teach us shorthand? How much I should like to learn! Only,\n",
      "mamma thought we had not time. But now, this would be such a good opportunity. I am sure I\n",
      "could learn it well in six weeks; and how convenient it would be! One could take down sermons,\n",
      "or anything; and I could make Rachel learn, and then how very pleasant it would be to write\n",
      "to each other in shorthand! Indeed, it would be convenient in a hundred ways.\" So saying, she\n",
      "ran upstairs, without any further delay, and putting on her hat and spencer, set off to old\n",
      "Mr. Henderson's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Henderson happened to be at dinner. Nevertheless, Charlotte obtained admittance on the\n",
      "plea of urgent business; but she entered his apartment so much out of breath, and in such apparent\n",
      "agitation, that the old gentleman, rising hastily from table, and looking anxiously at her\n",
      "over his spectacles, inquired in a tremulous tone what was the matter. When, therefore, Charlotte\n",
      "explained her business, he appeared a little disconcerted; but having gently reproved her for\n",
      "her undue eagerness, he composedly resumed his knife and fork, though his hand shook much more\n",
      "than usual during the remainder of his meal. However, being very good-natured, as soon as he\n",
      "had dined he cheerfully gave Charlotte her first lesson in shorthand, promising to repeat it\n",
      "regularly every morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte returned home in high glee. She at this juncture considered shorthand as one of the\n",
      "most useful, and decidedly the most interesting of acquirements; and she continued to exercise\n",
      "herself in it all the rest of the day. She was exceedingly pleased at being able already to\n",
      "write two or three words which neither her sister nor even her father could decipher. For three\n",
      "successive mornings Charlotte punctually kept her appointment with Mr. Henderson; but on the\n",
      "fourth she sent a shabby excuse to her kind master; and, if the truth must be told, he from\n",
      "that time saw no more of his scholar. Now the cause of this desertion was twofold: first, and\n",
      "principally, her zeal for shorthand, which for the last eight-and-forty hours had been sensibly\n",
      "declining in its temperature, was, on the above morning, within half a degree of freezing point;\n",
      "and, second, a new and far more arduous and important undertaking had by this time suggested\n",
      "itself to her mind. Like many young persons of desultory inclinations, Charlotte often amused\n",
      "herself with writing verses; and it now occurred to her that an abridged history of England\n",
      "in verse was still a desideratum in literature. She commenced this task with her usual diligence;\n",
      "but was somewhat discouraged in the outset by the difficulty of finding a rhyme to Saxon, whom\n",
      "she indulged the unpatriotic wish that the Danes had laid a tax on. But, though she got over\n",
      "this obstacle by a new construction of the line, she found these difficulties occur so continually\n",
      "that she soon felt a more thorough disgust at this employment than at the preceding one. So\n",
      "the epic stopped short, some hundred years before the Norman conquest. Difficulty, which quickens\n",
      "the ardor of industry, always damps, and generally extinguishes, the false zeal of caprice\n",
      "and versatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte's next undertaking was, to be sure, a rapid descent from the last in the scale of\n",
      "dignity. She now thought, that, by working very hard during the remainder of the time, she\n",
      "should be able to accomplish a patch-work counterpane, large enough for her own little tent\n",
      "bed; and the ease of this employment formed a most agreeable contrast in her mind with the\n",
      "extreme difficulty of the last. Accordingly, as if commissioned with a search warrant, she\n",
      "ransacked all her mother's drawers, bags, and bundles in quest of new pieces; and these spoils\n",
      "proving very insufficient, she set off to tax all her friends, and to tease all the linen drapers\n",
      "in the town for their odds and ends, urging that she wanted some particularly. As she was posting\n",
      "along the street on this business, she espied at a distance a person whom she had no wish to\n",
      "encounter, namely, old Mr. Henderson. To avoid the meeting she crossed over. But this maneuver\n",
      "did not succeed; for no sooner had they come opposite to each other, than, to her great confusion,\n",
      "he called out across the street, in his loud and tremulous voice, and shaking his stick at\n",
      "her, \"How d'ye do, Miss Shorthand? I thought how it would be! Oh, fie! Oh, fie!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte hurried on; and her thoughts soon returned to the idea of the splendid radiating\n",
      "star which she designed for the centerpiece of her counterpane. While she was arranging the\n",
      "different patterns, and forming the alternations of light and shade, her interest continued\n",
      "nearly unabated; but when she came to the practical part of sewing piece to piece with unvarying\n",
      "sameness, it began, as usual, to flag. She sighed several times, and cast many disconsolate\n",
      "looks at the endless hexagons and octagons, before she indulged any distinct idea of relinquishing\n",
      "her task. At length, however, it did forcibly occur to her that, after all, she was not obliged\n",
      "to go on with it; and that, really, patchwork was a thing that was better done by degrees,\n",
      "when one happens to want a job, than to be finished all at once. So, with this thought (which\n",
      "would have been a very good one if it had occurred in proper time), she suddenly drew out her\n",
      "needle, thrust all her pieces, arranged and unarranged, into a drawer, and began to meditate\n",
      "a new project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, just at this juncture some young ladies of their acquaintance called upon Charlotte\n",
      "and Caroline. They were attempting to establish a society among their young friends for working\n",
      "for the poor, and came to request their assistance. Caroline very cheerfully entered into the\n",
      "design; but as for Charlotte, nothing could exceed the forwardness of her zeal. She took it\n",
      "up so warmly that Caroline's appeared, in comparison, only lukewarm. It was proposed that each\n",
      "member of the society should have an equal proportion of the work to do at her own house; but\n",
      "when the articles came to be distributed, Charlotte, in the heat of her benevolence, desired\n",
      "that a double portion might be allotted to her. Some of the younger ones admired her industrious\n",
      "intentions, but the better judging advised her not to undertake too much at once. However,\n",
      "she would not be satisfied till her request was complied with. When the parcels of work arrived,\n",
      "Charlotte with exultation seized the larger one, and without a minute's delay commenced her\n",
      "charitable labors. The following morning she rose at four o'clock, to resume the employment;\n",
      "and not a little self-complacency did she feel, when, after nearly two hours' hard work, she\n",
      "still heard Caroline breathing in a sound sleep. But, alas! Charlotte soon found that work\n",
      "is work, of whatever nature, or for whatever purpose. She now inwardly regretted that she had\n",
      "asked for more than her share; and the cowardly thought that after all she was not obliged\n",
      "to do it next occurred to her. For the present, therefore, she squeezed all the things, done\n",
      "and undone, into what she called her \"Dorcas bag;\" and to banish unpleasant thoughts, she opened\n",
      "the first book that happened to lie within reach. It proved to be \"An Introduction to Botany.\"\n",
      "Of this she had not read more than a page and a half before she determined to collect some\n",
      "specimens herself; and having found a blank copy-book she hastened into the garden, where,\n",
      "gathering a few common flowers, she proceeded to dissect them, not, it is to be feared, with\n",
      "much scientific nicety. Perhaps as many as three pages of this copy-book were bespread with\n",
      "her specimens before she discovered that botany was a dry study.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be too tedious to enumerate all the subsequent ephemeral undertakings which filled\n",
      "up the remainder of the six weeks. At the expiration of that time Mrs. Dawson returned. On\n",
      "the next morning after her arrival she reminded her daughters of the account she expected of\n",
      "their employments during her absence, and desired them to set out on two tables in the schoolroom\n",
      "everything they had done that could be exhibited, together with the books they had been reading.\n",
      "Charlotte would gladly have been excused her part of the exhibition; but this was not permitted;\n",
      "and she reluctantly followed her sister to make the preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the two tables were spread, their mother was summoned to attend. Caroline's, which was\n",
      "first examined, contained, first, her various exercises in the different branches of study,\n",
      "regularly executed the same as usual. And there were papers placed in the books she was reading\n",
      "in school hours, to show how far she had proceeded in them. Besides these, she had read in\n",
      "her leisure time, in French, Florian's \"Numa Pompilius,\" and in English, Mrs. More's \"Practical\n",
      "Piety,\" and some part of Johnson's \"Lives of the Poets.\" All the needlework which had been\n",
      "left to do or not, at her option, was neatly finished; and her parcel of linen for the poor\n",
      "was also completely and well done. The only instance in which Caroline had availed herself\n",
      "of her mother's license, was that she had prolonged her drawing lessons a little every day,\n",
      "in order to present her mother with a pretty pair of screens, with flowers copied from nature.\n",
      "These were, last of all, placed on the table with an affectionate note, requesting her acceptance\n",
      "of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dawson, having carefully examined this table, proceeded to the other, which was quite\n",
      "piled up with different articles. Here, amid the heap, were Charlotte's three pages of shorthand;\n",
      "several scraps of paper containing fragments of her poetical history; the piece (not large\n",
      "enough for a doll's cradle) of her patchwork counterpane; her botanical specimens; together\n",
      "with the large unfinished pile out of the Dorcas bag, many of the articles of which were begun,\n",
      "but not one quite finished. There was a baby's cap with no border, a frock body without sleeves,\n",
      "and the skirt only half hemmed at the bottom; and slides, tapes, and buttonholes were all,\n",
      "without exception, omitted. After these, followed a great variety of thirds, halves, and quarters\n",
      "of undertakings, each perhaps good in itself, but quite useless in its unfinished state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The examination being at length ended, Mrs. Dawson retired, without a single comment, to her\n",
      "dressing-room; where, in about an hour afterwards, she summoned the girls to attend her. Here\n",
      "also were two tables laid out, with several articles on each. Their mother then leading Caroline\n",
      "to the first, told her that, as the reward of her industry and perseverance, the contents of\n",
      "the table were her own. Here, with joyful surprise, she beheld, first, a little gold watch,\n",
      "which Mrs. Dawson said she thought a suitable present for one who had made a good use of her\n",
      "time; a small telescope next appeared; and lastly, Paley's \"Natural Theology,\" neatly bound.\n",
      "Charlotte was then desired to take possession of the contents of the other table, which were\n",
      "considerably more numerous. The first prize she drew out was a very beautiful French fan; but\n",
      "upon opening it, it stretched out in an oblong shape, for want of the pin to confine the sticks\n",
      "at bottom. Then followed a new parasol; but when unfurled there was no catch to confine it,\n",
      "so that it would not remain spread. A penknife handle without a blade, and the blade without\n",
      "the handle, next presented themselves to her astonished gaze. In great confusion she then unrolled\n",
      "a paper which discovered a telescope apparently like her sister's; but on applying it to her\n",
      "eye, she found it did not contain a single lens--so that it was no better than a roll of pasteboard.\n",
      "She was, however, greatly encouraged to discover that the last remaining article was a watch;\n",
      "for, as she heard it tick, she felt no doubt that this at least was complete; but upon examination\n",
      "she discovered that there was no hour hand, the minute hand alone pursuing its lonely and useless\n",
      "track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte, whose conscience had very soon explained to her the moral of all this, now turned\n",
      "from the tantalizing table in confusion, and burst into an agony of tears. Caroline wept also;\n",
      "and Mrs. Dawson, after an interval of silence, thus addressed her daughters:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is quite needless for me to explain my reasons for making you such presents, Charlotte.\n",
      "I assure you your papa and I have had a very painful employment the past hour in spoiling them\n",
      "all for you. If I had found on your table in the schoolroom any one thing that had been properly\n",
      "finished, you would have received one complete present to answer it; but this you know was\n",
      "not the case. I should be very glad if this disappointment should teach you what I have hitherto\n",
      "vainly endeavored to impress upon you--that as all those things, pretty or useful as they are\n",
      "in themselves, are rendered totally useless for want of completeness, so exertion without perseverance\n",
      "is no better than busy idleness. That employment does not deserve the name of industry which\n",
      "requires the stimulus of novelty to keep it going. Those who will only work so long as they\n",
      "are amused will do no more good in the world, either to themselves or others, than those who\n",
      "refuse to work at all. If I had required you to pass the six weeks of my absence in bed or\n",
      "in counting your fingers, you would, I suppose, have thought it a sad waste of time; and yet\n",
      "I appeal to you whether (with the exception of an hour or two of needlework) the whole mass\n",
      "of articles on your table could produce anything more useful. And thus, my dears, may life\n",
      "be squandered away, in a succession of busy nothings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have now a proposal to make to you. These presents, which you are to take possession of\n",
      "as they are, I advise you to lay by carefully. Whenever you can show me anything that you have\n",
      "begun, and voluntarily finished, you may at the same time bring with you one of these things,\n",
      "beginning with those of least value, to which I will immediately add the part that is deficient.\n",
      "Thus, by degrees, you may have them all completed; and if by this means you should acquire\n",
      "the wise and virtuous habit of perseverance, it will be far more valuable to you than the richest\n",
      "present you could possibly receive.\" No; her father's name was Meanwell; and he was for many\n",
      "years a considerable farmer in the parish where Margery was born; but by the misfortunes which\n",
      "he met with in business, and the wicked persecutions of Sir Timothy Gripe, and an overgrown\n",
      "farmer called Graspall, he was effectually ruined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case was thus: The parish of Mould well, where they lived, had for many ages been let by\n",
      "the lord of the manor in twelve different farms, in which the tenants lived comfortably, brought\n",
      "up large families, and carefully supported the poor people who labored for them, until the\n",
      "estate by marriage and by death came into the hands of Sir Timothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, gentleman, who loved himself better than all his neighbors, thought it was less trouble\n",
      "to write one receipt for his rent than twelve; and Farmer Graspall offering to take all the\n",
      "farms as the leases expired, Sir Timothy agreed with him, and in process of time he was possessed\n",
      "of every farm but that occupied by little Margery's father, which he also wanted; for as Mr.\n",
      "Meanwell was a charitable, good man, he stood up for the poor at the parish meetings, and was\n",
      "unwilling to have them oppressed by Sir Timothy and this avaricious farmer. Judge, O kind,\n",
      "humane, and courteous reader, what a terrible situation the poor must be in, when this covetous\n",
      "man was perpetual overseer, and everything for their maintenance was drawn from his hard heart\n",
      "and cruel hand. But he was not only perpetual overseer, but perpetual churchwarden; and judge,\n",
      "O ye Christians, what state the church must be in, when supported by a man without religion\n",
      "or virtue. He was also perpetual surveyor of the highways, and what sort of roads he kept up\n",
      "for the convenience of travelers, those best knew who have had the misfortune to pass through\n",
      "that parish. Complaints indeed were made, but to what purpose are complaints, when brought\n",
      "against a man who can hunt, drink, and smoke, without the lord of the manor, who is also the\n",
      "justice of peace?\n",
      "\n",
      "The opposition which Little Margery's father made to this man's tyranny gave offense to Sir\n",
      "Timothy, who endeavored to force him out of his farm; and, to oblige him to throw up the lease,\n",
      "ordered both a brick-kiln and a dog kennel to be erected in the farmer's orchard. This was\n",
      "contrary to law, and a suit was commenced, in which Margery's father got the better. The same\n",
      "offense was again committed three different times, and as many actions brought, in all of which\n",
      "the farmer had a verdict, and costs paid him; but notwithstanding these advantages, the law\n",
      "was so expensive, that he was ruined in the contest, and obliged to give up all he had to his\n",
      "creditors; which effectually answered the purpose of Sir Timothy, who erected those nuisances\n",
      "in the farmer's orchard with that intention. Ah, my dear reader, we brag of liberty, and boast\n",

      "where he died miserably. Margery's poor mother survived the loss of her husband but a few days,\n",
      "and died of a broken heart, leaving Margery and her little brother to the wide world; but,\n",
      "poor woman, it would have melted your heart to have seen how frequently she heaved her head,\n",
      "while she lay speechless, to survey with languishing looks her little orphans, as much as to\n",
      "say, \"Do, Tommy, do, Margery, come with me.\" They cried, poor things, and she sighed away her\n",

      "It would both have excited your pity, and have done your heart good, to have seen how these\n",

      "poor things, to support them (not being in their own parish) but what they picked from the\n",

      "no notice of them; no, they were rich, and ashamed to own such a poor little ragged girl as\n",
      "Margery, and such a dirty little curly-pated boy as Tommy. Our relations and friends seldom\n",
      "take notice of us when we are poor; but as we grow rich they grow fond. And this will always\n",

      "were born; and having a relation come to see him, who was a charitable, good man, he sent for\n",
      "these children to come to him. The gentleman ordered Little Margery a new pair of shoes, gave\n",

      "his travels, and adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parting between these little children was very affecting. Tommy cried, and they kissed\n",

      "HOW LITTLE MARGERY OBTAINED THE NAME OF GOODY TWO-SHOES, AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARISH\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Little Margery got up in the morning, which was very early, she ran all round the\n",
      "village, crying for her brother; and after some time returned greatly distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at this instant, the shoemaker very opportunely came in with the new shoes, for which\n",
      "she had been measured by the gentleman's order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could have supported Little Margery under the affliction she was in for the loss of\n",
      "her brother, but the pleasure she took in her two shoes. She ran out to Mrs. Smith as soon\n",
      "as they were put on, and stroking down her ragged apron thus cried out, \"Two shoes, ma'am,\n",
      "see two shoes.\" And so she behaved to all the people she met, and by that means obtained the\n",
      "name of Goody Two-Shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Margery was very happy in being with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who were very charitable and\n",
      "good to her, and had agreed to bring her up with their family: but as soon as that tyrant of\n",
      "the parish, that Graspall, heard of her being there, he applied first to Mr. Smith, and threatened\n",
      "to reduce his tithes if he kept her; and after that he spoke to Sir Timothy, who sent Mr. Smith\n",
      "a peremptory message by his servant, that he should send back Meanwell's girl to be kept by\n",
      "her relations, and not harbor her in the parish. This so distressed Mr. Smith, that he shed\n",
      "tears, and cried, \"Lord, have mercy on the poor!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prayers of the righteous fly upwards, and reach unto the throne of heaven, as will be seen\n",
      "by the sequel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Smith was also greatly concerned at being thus obliged to discard poor Little Margery.\n",

      "\n",
      "Little Margery saw how good and how wise Mr. Smith was, and concluded that this was owing to\n",
      "his great learning, therefore she wanted of all things to learn to read. For this purpose she\n",
      "used to meet the little boys as they came from school, borrow their books, and sit down and\n",
      "read till they returned. By this means she got more learning than any of her playmates, and\n",
      "laid the following scheme for instructing those who were more ignorant than herself. She found\n",
      "that only the following letters were required to spell all the words; but as some of these\n",
      "letters are large, and some small, she with her knife cut out of several pieces of wood ten\n",
      "sets of each of these:\n",
      "\n",
      "a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.\n",
      "\n",
      "And having got an old spelling book, she made her companions set up all the words they wanted\n",
      "to spell, and after that she taught them to compose sentences. \"You know what a sentence is,\n",
      "my dear. 'I will be good' is a sentence; and is made up, as you see, of several words.\"\n",

      "tap, tap. \"Who's there?\" \"Only Little Goody Two-Shoes,\" answered Margery, \"come to teach Billy.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! Little Goody,\" says Mrs. Wilson, with pleasure in her face, \"I am glad to see you Billy\n",
      "wants you sadly for he has learned his lesson.\" Then out came the little boy. \"How do, Doody\n",
      "Two-Shoes,\" says he, not able to speak plain. Yet this little boy had learned all his letters;\n",

      "Little Two-Shoes? come in, Madge; here, Sally wants you sadly, she has learned all her lesson.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, Little Two-Shoes taught her to spell words of one syllable, and she soon set up\n",

      "cock, hen, and many more.\n",

      "The next place we came to was Gaffer Cook's cottage. Here a number of poor children were met\n",
      "to learn, who all came round Little Margery at once, who having pulled out her letters, asked\n",
      "the little boy next her what he had for dinner? Who answered, \"Bread\" (the poor children in\n",

      "\n",
      "And what had you, Polly Comb, for your dinner? \"Apple Pie,\" answered the little girl; upon\n",

      "the clerk, and wanted him to go to see what it was; but William said he was sure it was a ghost,\n",
      "and that he would not offer to open the door. At length Mr. Long, the rector, hearing such\n",
      "an uproar in the village, went to the clerk, to know why he did not go into the church, and\n",
      "see who was there. \"I go, sir?\" says William; \"why, the ghost would frighten me out of my wits!\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dobbins, too, cried, and laying hold of her husband, said he should not be eat up by the\n",

      "in a church, or know anybody that did?\" \"Yes,\" says the clerk, \"my father did once in the shape\n",
      "of a windmill, and it walked all around the church in a trice, with jack boots on, and had\n",
      "a gun by its side, instead of a sword.\" \"A fine picture of a ghost, truly,\" says Mr. Long;\n",

      "clock I awoke; which I believe was in some measure occasioned by the clock's striking, for\n",
      "I heard it. I started up, and could not at first tell where I was; but after some time I recollected\n",
      "the funeral, and soon found that I was shut in the church. It was dismal dark, and I could\n",
      "see nothing; but while I was standing in the pew, something jumped up upon me behind, and laid,\n",

      "cold as marble, ay, as cold as ice, touched my neck, which made me start, however, I continued\n",
      "my prayers, and having begged protection from Almighty God, I found my spirits come, and I\n",

      "but also all those who endeavor to be good--nothing can withstand the power, and exceed the\n",
      "goodness of God Almighty. Armed with the confidence of his protection; I walked down the church\n",
      "aisle, when I heard something pit, pat, pit, pat, pit, pat, come after me, and something touched\n",
      "my hand, which seemed as cold as a marble monument. I could not think what this was, yet I\n",
      "knew that it could not hurt me, and therefore I made myself easy; but being very cold, and\n",
      "the church being paved with stones, which were very damp, I felt my way, as well as I could,\n",

      "dog, which had followed me from their house to church; so I opened the door, and called Snip,\n",
      "Snip, and the dog jumped upon me immediately. After this, Snip and I lay down together, and\n",
      "had a comfortable nap; for when I awoke again it was almost light. I then walked up and down\n",
      "all the aisles of the church to keep myself warm; and though I went into the vaults, and trod\n",
      "on Lady Ducklington's coffin, I saw nothing, and I believe it was owing to the reason Mr. Long\n",
      "has given you, namely, that there is no such thing to be seen. As to my part, I would as soon\n",
      "lie all night in a church as in any other place; and I am sure that any little boy or girl,\n",

      "I very well remember, when the children having learned their lessons soon, she had given them\n",
      "leave to play, and they were all running about the school, and diverting themselves with the\n",
      "birds and the lamb; at this time the dog, all of a sudden, laid hold of his mistress's apron,\n",
      "and endeavored to pull her out of the school. She was at first surprised; however, she followed\n",
      "him, to see what he intended. No sooner had he led her back into the garden, but he ran back,\n",
      "and pulled out one of the children in the same manner; upon which she ordered them all to leave\n",
      "the school immediately, and they had not been out five minutes before the top of the house\n",
      "fell in. What a miraculous deliverance was here! How gracious! How good was God Almighty to\n",
      "save all these children from destruction, and to make use of such an instrument as a little\n",
      "sagacious animal to accomplish his divine will! I should have observed that, as soon as they\n",
      "were all in the garden, the dog came leaping round them to express his joy, and when the house\n",
      "was fallen, laid himself down quietly by his mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the neighbors who saw the school fall, and who were in great pain for Margery and her\n",
      "little ones, soon spread the news through the village, and all the parents, terrified for their\n",
      "children, came crowding in abundance; they had, however, the satisfaction to find them all\n",

      "The downfall of the school was a great misfortune to Mrs. Margery; for she not only lost all\n",
      "her books, but was destitute of a place to teach in; but Sir William Dove, being informed of\n",
      "this, ordered it to be built at his own expense, and till that could be done, Farmer Grove\n",

      "\n",
      "While at Mr. Grove's, which was in the heart of the village, she not only taught the children\n",
      "in the daytime, but the farmer's servants and all the neighbors to read and write in the evening;\n",
      "and it was a constant practice, before they went away, to make them all go to prayers and sing\n",
      "psalms. By this means the people grew extremely regular, his servants were always at home instead\n",
      "of being at the alehouse, and he had more work done than ever. This gave not only Mr. Grove,\n",
      "but all the neighbors, a high opinion of her good sense and prudent behavior; and she was so\n",
      "much esteemed that the most of the differences in the parish were left to her decision; and\n",
      "if a man and wife quarreled (which sometimes happened in that part of the kingdom), both parties\n",
      "certainly came to her for advice. Everybody knows that Martha Wilson was a passionate, scolding\n",
      "jade, and that John her husband was a surly, ill-tempered fellow. These were one day brought\n",
      "by the neighbors for Margery to talk to them, when they talked before her, and were going to\n",
      "blows; but she, stepping between them, thus addressed the husband: \"John,\" says she, \"you are\n",
      "a man, and ought to have more sense than to fly in a passion at every word that is said amiss\n",
      "by your wife: and Martha,\" says she, \"you ought to know your duty better than to say anything\n",
      "to aggravate your husband's resentment. These frequent quarrels arise from the indulgence of\n",
      "your violent passions; for I know you both love each other, notwithstanding what has passed\n",
      "between you. Now, pray tell me, John, and tell me, Martha, when you have had a quarrel over\n",
      "night, are you not both sorry for it the next day?\" They both declared that they were. \"Why,\n",
      "then,\" says she, \"I'll tell you how to prevent this for the future, if you promise to take\n",
      "my advice.\" They both promised her. \"You know,\" says she, \"that a small spark will set fire\n",
      "to tinder, and that tinder properly placed will set fire to a house: an angry word is with\n",
      "you as that spark, for you are both as touchy as tinder, and very often make your own house\n",
      "too hot to hold you. To prevent this, therefore, and to live happily for the future, you must\n",
      "solemnly agree, that if one speaks an angry word, the other will not answer, till he or she\n",
      "has distinctly called over the alphabet, and the other not reply till he has told twenty; by\n",
      "this means your passions will be stifled, and reason will have time to take the rule.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Margery was always doing good, and thought she could never sufficiently gratify those\n",
      "who had done anything to serve her. These generous sentiments naturally led her to consult\n",
      "the interest of Mr. Grove, and the rest of her neighbors; and as most of their lands were meadow,\n",
      "and they depended much on their hay, which had been for many years greatly damaged by the wet\n",
      "weather, she contrived an instrument to direct them when to mow their grass with safety, and\n",
      "prevent their hay being spoiled. They all came to her for advice, and by that means got in\n",
      "their hay without damage, while most of that in the neighboring village was spoiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occasioned a very great noise in the country, and so greatly provoked were the people\n",
      "who resided in the other parishes, that they absolutely sent old Gaffer Goosecap (a busy fellow\n",
      "in other people's concerns) to find out evidence against her. The wiseacre happened to come\n",
      "to her to school, when she was walking about with a raven on one shoulder, a pigeon on the\n",
      "other, a lark on her hand, and a lamb and a dog by her side; which indeed made a droll figure,\n",
      "and so surprised the man that he cried out, \"A witch! a witch! a witch!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this she, laughing, answered, \"a conjurer! a conjurer! a conjurer!\" and so they parted;\n",
      "but it did not end thus, for a warrant was issued out against Mrs. Margery, and she was carried\n",
      "to a meeting of the justices.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the meeting, one of the justices who knew little of life, and less of the law, behaved very\n",
      "idly; and, though nobody was able to prove anything against her, asked who she could bring\n",
      "to her character. \"Who can you bring against my character, sir?\" says she. \"There are people\n",
      "enough who would appear in my defense, were it necessary: but I never supposed that any one\n",
      "here could be so weak as to believe there was any such thing as a witch. If I am a witch, this\n",
      "is my charm; and\" (laying a barometer or weather-glass on the table) \"it is with this,\" says\n",
      "she, \"that I have taught my neighbor to know the state of the weather.\" All the company laughed;\n",
      "and Sir William Dove, who was on the bench, asked her accusers how they could be such fools\n",
      "as to think there was any such thing as a witch?\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, Sir William inveighed against the absurd and foolish notions which the country\n",
      "people had imbibed concerning witches and witchcraft, and having proved that there was no such\n",
      "thing, but that all were the effects of folly and ignorance, he gave the court such an account\n",
      "of Mrs. Margery, and her virtue, good sense, and prudent behavior, that the gentlemen present\n",
      "were enamored with her, and returned her public thanks for the great service she had done the\n",
      "country. One gentleman in particular, I mean Sir Charles Jones, had conceived such a high opinion\n",
      "of her that he offered her a considerable sum to take care of his family, and the education\n",
      "of his daughter, which, however, she refused; but this gentleman sending for her afterwards,\n",
      "when he had a dangerous fit of illness, she went, and behaved so prudently in the family, and\n",
      "so tenderly to him and his daughter, that he would not permit her to leave his house, but soon\n",
      "after made her proposals of marriage. She was truly sensible of the honor he intended her,\n",
      "but, though poor, she would not consent to be made a lady till he had effectually provided\n",
      "for his daughter; for she told him that power was a dangerous thing to be trusted with, and\n",
      "that a good man or woman would never throw themselves into the road of temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "All things being settled, and the day fixed, the neighbors came in crowds to see the wedding;\n",
      "for they were all glad that one who had been such a good little girl, and was become such a\n",
      "virtuous and good woman, was going to be made a lady; but just as the clergyman had opened\n",
      "his book, a gentleman richly dressed ran into the church and cried, \"Stop! stop!\" This greatly\n",
      "alarmed the congregation, particularly the intended bride and bridegroom, whom he first accosted\n",
      "and desired to speak with them apart. After they had been talking some little time, the people\n",
      "were greatly surprised to see Sir Charles stand motionless, and his bride cry and faint away\n",
      "in the stranger's arms. This seeming grief, however, was only a prelude to a flood of joy which\n",
      "immediately succeeded; for you must know, gentle reader, that this gentleman, so richly dressed,\n",
      "was that identical little boy, whom you before saw in the sailor's habit; in short, it was\n",

      "taken a rich prize; and hearing, as soon as he landed, of his sister's intended wedding, had\n",
      "rode post to see that a proper settlement was made on her, which she was now entitled to, as\n",
      "he himself was both able and willing to give her an ample fortune. They soon returned to the\n",

      "caravan which moved along the yellow sand like a procession of black insects. She was so accustomed\n",
      "to search the desert since the days, long ago, when she had actually hoped for friends to come\n",
      "and take her away, that she could differentiate objects at greater distances than one less\n",
      "trained to observation. Hardly thinking of the caravan, she made out, nevertheless, that it\n",
      "consisted of two camels, carrying bassourahs, a horse and Arab rider, a brown pack camel, and\n",
      "a loaded mule, driven by two men who walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had evidently come from Oued Tolga, or at least from that direction, therefore it was\n",
      "probable that their destination was the ZaouÃ¯a; otherwise, as it was already late, they would\n",
      "have stopped in the city all night. Of course, it was possible that they were on their way\n",
      "to the village, but it was a poor place, inhabited by very poor people, many of them freed\n",
      "Negroes, who worked in the oases and lived mostly upon dates. No caravans ever went out from\n",
      "there, because no man, even the richest, owned more than one camel or donkey; and nobody came\n",
      "to stay, unless some son of the miserable hamlet, who had made a little money elsewhere, and\n",
      "returned to see his relatives. But on the other hand, numerous caravans arrived at the ZaouÃ¯a\n",
      "of Oued Tolga, and hundreds of pilgrims from all parts of Islam were entertained as the marabout's\n",
      "guests, or as recipients of charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimly, as she detached her mind from the message she had sent, the woman began to wonder about\n",
      "this caravan, because of the bassourahs, which meant that there were women among the travellers.\n",
      "There were comparatively few women pilgrims to the ZaouÃ¯a, except invalids from the town of\n",
      "Oued Tolga, or some Sahara encampment, who crawled on foot, or rode decrepit donkeys, hoping\n",
      "to be cured of ailments by the magic power of the marabout, the power of the Baraka. The woman\n",
      "who watched had learned by this time not to expect European tourists. She had lived for eight\n",
      "years in the ZaouÃ¯a, and not once had she seen from her roof a European, except a French government-official\n",
      "or two, and a few--a very few--French officers. Never had any European women come. Tourists\n",
      "were usually satisfied with Touggourt, three or four days nearer civilisation. Women did not\n",
      "care to undertake an immense and fatiguing journey among the most formidable dunes of the desert,\n",
      "where there was nothing but ascending and descending, day after day; where camels sometimes\n",
      "broke their legs in the deep sand, winding along the fallen side of a mountainous dune, and\n",
      "where a horse often had to sit on his haunches, and slide with his rider down a sand precipice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She herself had experienced all these difficulties, so long ago now that she had half forgotten\n",
      "how she had hated them, and the fate to which they were leading her. But she did not blame\n",
      "other women for not coming to Oued Tolga.\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally some caÃ¯d or agha of the far south would bring his wife who was ill or childless\n",
      "to be blessed by the marabout; and in old days they had been introduced to the marabouta, but\n",
      "it was years now since she had been asked, or even allowed, to entertain strangers. She thought,\n",
      "without any active interest, as she looked at the nodding bassourahs, growing larger and larger,\n",
      "that a chief was coming with his women, and that he would be disappointed to learn that the\n",
      "marabout was away from home. It was rather odd that the stranger had not been told in the city,\n",
      "for every one knew that the great man had gone a fortnight ago to the province of Oran. Several\n",
      "days must pass before he could return, even if, for any reason, he came sooner than he was\n",
      "expected. But it did not matter much to her, if there were to be visitors who would have the\n",
      "pain of waiting. There was plenty of accommodation for guests, and there were many servants\n",
      "whose special duty it was to care for strangers. She would not see the women in the bassourahs,\n",
      "nor hear of them unless some gossip reached her through the talk of the negresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as there was nothing else which she wished to do, she continued to watch the caravan.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by it passed out of sight, behind the rising ground on which the village huddled, with\n",
      "its crowding brown house-walls that narrowed towards the roofs. The woman almost forgot it,\n",
      "until it appeared again, to the left of the village, where palm logs had been laid in the river\n",
      "bed, making a kind of rough bridge, only covered when the river was in flood. It was certain\n",
      "now that the travellers were coming to the ZaouÃ¯a.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flame of the sunset had died, though clouds purple as pansies flowered in the west. The\n",
      "gold of the dunes paled to silver, and the desert grew sad, as if it mourned for a day that\n",
      "would never live again. Far away, near Oued Tolga, where the white domes of the city and the\n",
      "green domes of the oasis palms all blended together in shadow, fires sprang up in the camps\n",
      "of nomads, like signals of danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman on the roof shivered. The chill of the coming night cooled her excitement. She was\n",
      "afraid of the future, and the sadness which had fallen upon the desert was cold in her heart.\n",
      "The caravan was not far from the gate of the ZaouÃ¯a, but she was tired of watching it. She\n",
      "turned and went down the narrow stairs that led to her rooms, and to the little garden where\n",
      "the fragrance of orange blossoms was too sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "XXXV\n",
      "\n",
      "The caravan stopped in front of the ZaouÃ¯a gate. There were great iron doors in a high wall\n",
      "of toub, which was not much darker in colour than the deep gold of the desert sand; and because\n",
      "it was after sunset the doors were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the Negroes knocked, and called out something inarticulate and guttural in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at once the gate opened, and a shadowy figure hovered inside. A name was announced,\n",
      "which was instantly shouted to a person unseen, and a great chattering began in the dusk. Men\n",
      "ran out, and one or two kissed the hand of the rider on the white horse. They explained volubly\n",
      "that the lord was away, but the newcomer checked them as soon as he could, saying that he had\n",
      "heard the news in the city. He had with him ladies, one a relative of his own, another who\n",
      "was connected with the great lord himself, and they must be entertained as the lord would wish,\n",
      "were he not absent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gates, or doors, of iron were thrown wide open, and the little procession entered a huge\n",
      "open court. On one side was accommodation for many animals, as in a caravanserai, with a narrow\n",
      "roof sheltering thirty or forty stalls; and here the two white meharis were made to kneel,\n",
      "that the women might descend from their bassourahs. There were three, all veiled, but the arms\n",
      "of one were bare and very brown. She moved stiffly, as if cramped by sitting for a long time\n",
      "in one position; nevertheless, she supported her companion, whose bassour she had shared. The\n",
      "two Soudanese Negroes remained in this court with their animals, which the servants of the\n",
      "ZaouÃ¯a, began helping them to unload; but the master of the expedition, with the two ladies\n",
      "of his party and Fafann, was now obliged to walk. Several men of the ZaouÃ¯a acted as their\n",
      "guides, gesticulating with great respect, but lowering their eyelids, and appearing not to\n",
      "see the women.\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through another court, very large, though not so immense as the first, for no animals\n",
      "were kept there. Instead of stalls for camels and horses, there were roughly built rooms for\n",
      "pilgrims of the poorer class, with little, roofless, open-sided kitchens, where they could\n",
      "cook their own food. Beyond was the third court, with lodging for more important persons, and\n",
      "then the travellers were led through a labyrinth of corridors, some roofed with palm branches,\n",
      "others open to the air, and still more covered in with the toub blocks of which the walls were\n",
      "built. Along the sides were crumbling benches of stucco, on which old men lay rolled up in\n",
      "their burnouses; or here and there a door of rotting palm wood hung half open, giving a glimpse\n",
      "into a small, dim court, duskily red with the fire of cooking in an open-air kitchen. From\n",
      "behind these doors came faint sounds of chanting, and spicy smells of burning wood and boiling\n",
      "peppers. It was like passing through a subterranean village; and little dark children, squatting\n",
      "in doorways, or flattening their bodies against palm trunks which supported palm roofs, or\n",
      "flitting ahead of the strangers, in the thick, musky scented twilight, were like shadowy gnomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by, as the newcomers penetrated farther into the mysterious labyrinth of the vast ZaouÃ¯a,\n",
      "the corridors and courts became less ruined in appearance. The walls were whitewashed; the\n",
      "palm-wood doors were roughly carved and painted in bright colours, which could be seen by the\n",
      "flicker of lamps set high in little niches. Each tunnel-like passage had a carved archway at\n",
      "the end, and at last they entered one which was closed in with beautiful doors of wrought iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the rich network they could see into a court where everything glimmered white in moonlight.\n",
      "They had come to the court of the mosque, which had on one side an entrance to the private\n",
      "house of the marabout, the great Sidi El Hadj Mohammed ben Abd-el-Kader.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was an hour since she had come down from the roof, and having eaten a little bread, with\n",
      "soup, she lay on a divan writing in a small book. Several tall copper lamps with open-work\n",
      "copper shades, jewelled and fringed with coloured glass, gave a soft and beautiful light to\n",
      "the room. It had pure white walls, round which, close to the ceiling, ran a frieze of Arab\n",
      "lettering, red, and black, and gold. The doors and window-blinds and little cupboards were\n",
      "of cedar, so thickly inlaid with mother-o'-pearl, that only dark lines of the wood defined\n",
      "the white patterning of leaves and flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman had thrown off the blue drapery that had covered her head, and her auburn hair glittered\n",
      "in the light of the lamp by which she wrote. She looked up, vexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest, Noura, that for years I have received no guests,\" she said, in a dialect of\n",
      "the Soudan, in which most Saharian mistresses of Negro servants learn to talk. \"I can see no\n",
      "one. The master would not permit me to do so, even if I wished it, which I do not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon, loveliest lady. But this is another matter. A friend of our lord brings these visitors\n",
      "to thee. One is kin of his. She seeks to be healed of a malady, by the power of the Baraka.\n",
      "But the other is a Roumia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wife of the great marabout shut the book in which she had been writing, and her mind travelled\n",
      "quickly to the sender of the carrier-pigeon. A European woman, the first who had ever come\n",
      "to the ZaouÃ¯a in eight years! It must be that she had a message from him. Somehow he had contrived\n",
      "this visit. She dared ask no more questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will see these ladies,\" she said. \"Let them come to me here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Already the old one is resting in the guest-house,\" answered the negress. \"She has her own\n",
      "servant, and she asks to see thee no earlier than to-morrow, when she has rested, and is able\n",
      "to pay thee her respects. It is the other, the young Roumia, who begs to speak with thee to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "yet she knew that she would be bitterly disappointed if, after all, the European woman were\n",
      "not what she thought. She shut up the diary in which she wrote each night, and opening one\n",
      "of the wall cupboards near her divan, she put it away on a shelf, where there were many other\n",
      "small volumes, a dozen perhaps. They contained the history of her life during the last nine\n",
      "years, since unhappiness had isolated her, and made it necessary to her peace of mind, almost\n",
      "to her sanity, to have a confidant. She closed the inlaid doors of the cupboard, and locked\n",
      "them with a key which hung from a ribbon inside her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a precaution was hardly needed, since the writing was all in English, and she had recorded\n",
      "the events of the last few weeks cautiously and cryptically. Not a soul in the marabout's house\n",
      "could read English, except the marabout himself; and it was seldom he honoured her with a visit.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it had become a habit to lock up the books, and she found a secretive pleasure in it.\n",

      "hardly changed in feature, and yet--there was something strange about her, something which\n",
      "stopped the joyous beating of the girl's heart. It was almost as if she had died and come to\n",
      "Heaven, to find that Heaven was not Heaven at all, but a cold place of fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was shocked at the impression, blaming herself. Surely Saidee did not know her yet, that\n",

      "that would have seemed banal, it would have been better than to see the blank look on Saidee's\n",

      "that she would not try. They should have been sweet as summer rain, but they burned her eyes\n",
      "and her cheeks as they fell. Saidee was silent. The girl held out her arms, running a step\n",

      "holding it tightly, in silence. But over the girl's shoulder, her eyes still seemed to search\n",
      "an answer to their question.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had had time to control her voice and expression, she spoke, releasing her sister,\n",

      "\"Victoria!\" she murmured. \"Victoria! I'm not dreaming you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, darling,\" the girl answered, more hopefully. \"No wonder you're dazed. This--finding\n",
      "you, I mean--has been the object of my life, ever since your letters stopped coming, and I\n",
      "began to feel I'd lost you. That's why I can't realize your being struck dumb with the surprise\n",

      "you believe it?--this is the first time I've spoken English with any human being for nine years--perhaps\n",
      "more. I almost forget--it seems a century. I talk to myself--so as not to forget. And every\n",
      "night I write down what has happened, or rather what I've thought, because things hardly ever\n",
      "do happen here. The words don't come easily. They sound so odd in my own ears. And then--there's\n",
      "another reason why I'm afraid. It's on your account. I'd better tell you. It wouldn't be fair\n",
      "not to tell. I--how are you going to get away again?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Victoria slipped a protecting arm round her waist. \"We are going away together, dearest,\" she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am tired of the things around me,\" Saidee said. \"Often I've felt like a dead body in a grave\n",
      "with no hope of even a resurrection. What were those lines of Christina Rossetti's I used to\n",
      "say over to myself at first, while it still seemed worth while to revolt? Some one was buried,\n",
      "had been buried for years, yet could think and feel, and cry out against the doom of lying\n",
      "'under this marble stone, forgotten, alone.' Doesn't it sound agonizing--desperate? It just\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Are things better? Are you happier?\" Victoria clasped her sister passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Only I'm past caring so much. If you've come here, Babe, to take me away, it's no use.\n",
      "I may as well tell you now. This is prison. And you must escape, yourself, before the gaoler\n",
      "comes back, or it will be a life-sentence for you, too.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You shall not be kept in prison!\" she exclaimed. \"It's monstrous--horrible! I was afraid it\n",
      "would be like this. That's why I had to wait and make plenty of money. Dearest, I'm rich. Everything's\n",
      "for you. You taught me to dance, and it's by dancing I've earned such a lot--almost a fortune.\n",
      "So you see, it's yours. I've got enough to bribe Cassim to let you go, if he likes money, and\n",

      "OLD POPULAR POETRY: \"ADAM BELL, CLYM OF THE CLOUGH, AND WILLIAM OF CLOWDESLY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have very recently become possessed of a curious printed fragment, which is worth notice\n",
      "on several accounts, and will be especially interesting to persons who, like myself, are lovers\n",
      "of our early ballad poetry. It is part of an unknown edition of the celebrated poem relating\n",
      "to the adventures of Adam Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William of Cloudesly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are (as many of your readers will be aware from Ritson's small volume, Pieces of Ancient\n",
      "Popular Poetry, 8vo. 1791) two old editions of Adam Bell, &c., one printed by William Copland,\n",
      "without date, and the other by James Roberts in 1605. The edition by Copland must have preceded\n",
      "that by Roberts by forty or fifty years, and may have come out between 1550 and 1560; the only\n",
      "known copy of it is among the Garrick Plays (at least it was so when I saw it) in the British\n",
      "Museum. The re-impression by Roberts is not very uncommon, and I think that more than one copy\n",
      "of it is at Oxford.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Copland printed the poem, he did not enter it at Stationers' Hall; comparatively few of\n",
      "his publications, generally of a free, romantic, or ludicrous character, were licensed, and\n",
      "he was three times fined for not first obtaining the leave of the Company. Nevertheless, we\n",
      "do find an entry of a \"book\" called \"Adam Bell,\" &c., among the memoranda belonging to the\n",
      "year 1557-8, but it was made at the instance, not of Copland, but of John Kynge, in this form:\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"To John Kynge, to prynte this boke called Adam Bell, &c., and for his\n",
      "    lycense he geveth to the howse\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "What sum he gave is not stated. Again, we meet with another notice of it in the same registers,\n",
      "under the date of 1581-2, when John Charlwood was interested in the undertaking. I mention\n",
      "these two entries principally because neither Ritson nor Percy were acquainted with them; but\n",
      "they may be seen among the extracts published by the Shakspeare Society in 1848 and 1849. {446}\n",
      "\n",
      "No impressions by Kynge or Charlwood having come down to us, we have no means of knowing whether\n",
      "they availed themselves of the permission granted at Stationers' Hall; and, unless I am deceived,\n",
      "the fragment which occasions this Note is not from the presses of either of them, and is of\n",
      "an earlier date than the time of Copland; the type is much better, and less battered, than\n",
      "that of Copland; at the same time it has a more antique look, and in several respects, which\n",
      "I am about to point out, it furnishes a better text than that given by Ritson from Copland's\n",
      "edition, or by Percy with the aid of his folio manuscript. I am sorry to say that it only consists\n",
      "of a single sheet; but this is nearly half the production, and it comprises the whole of the\n",
      "second, and two pages of the third \"fit.\" The first line and the last of the portion in my\n",
      "hands, testify to the greater antiquity and purity of the text there found; it begins--\n",
      "\n",
      " \"These gates be shut so wonderly well;\"\n",
      "\n",
      "and it ends,\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Tyll they came to the kynge's palays.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is \"wonderous well\" in Copland's impression, and palace is there spelt \"pallace,\" a more\n",
      "modern form of the word than palays. Just afterwards we have, in my fragment,\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Streyght comen from oure kyng,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of Copland's\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Streyght come nowe from our king.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Comen is considerably more ancient than \"come nowe;\" so that, without pursuing this point farther,\n",
      "I may say that my fragment is not only an older specimen of typography than Copland's impression,\n",
      "but older still in its words and phraseology, a circumstance that communicates to it additional\n",
      "interest. I subjoin a few various readings, most, if not all, of them presenting a superior\n",
      "text than is to be met with elsewhere. Speaking of the porter at the gate of Carlisle, we are\n",
      "told--\n",
      "\n",
      " \"And to the gate faste he throng.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Copland's edition omits faste, and it is not met with in Percy. In another place a rhyme is\n",
      "lost by an awkward transposition, \"he saide\" for sayd he; and farther on, in Copland's text,\n",
      "we have mention of\n",
      "\n",
      " \"The justice with a quest of squyers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of \"a quest of swerers,\" meaning of course the jury who had condemned Cloudesly \"there\n",
      "hanged to be.\" Another blunder committed by Copland is the omission of a word, so that a line\n",
      "is left without its corresponding rhyme:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Then Clowdysle cast hys eyen aside,\n",
      "    And sawe his two bretheren stande\n",
      "  At the corner of the market-place,\n",
      "    With theyr good bowes bent in theyr hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The word I print in Italics is entirely wanting in Copland. It is curious to see how Percy\n",
      "(Reliques, i. 157., ed. 1775) gets over the difficulty by following no known copy of the original:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Then Cloudesle cast his eyen asyde,\n",
      "    And saw hys brethren twaine\n",
      "  At a corner of the market-place,\n",
      "    Ready the justice for to slaine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloudesly is made to exclaim, in all editions but mine, \"I see comfort,\" instead of \"I see\n",

      "On the 26th February (Vol. vii., p. 217.) MR. COLLIER was good enough to say, that his only\n",

      "as may appear advisable in each particular case. It is difficult to conjecture what can have\n",
      "been the position in life, or the occupation of this mysterious annotator. That his pursuits\n",
      "were not purely literary, I think is plain: first, from the very circumstance of his not authenticating\n",
      "any of his notes, which a literary inquirer would certainly have done; and, secondly, from\n",
      "the very minute attention which is paid to the business of the scene and the movements of the\n",
      "actors. These considerations, coupled with the fact of his frequently striking out whole passages\n",
      "of the text (which a literary enthusiast would not have done), would at first lead us to suppose\n",
      "that the writer was a theatrical manager, and that the alterations were made to suit either\n",
      "the fancies, or perhaps the peculiar qualifications of certain performers. But in this case\n",
      "one can hardly suppose that the remarks would have extended to more than a certain number of\n",
      "plays, which were most frequently acted. Thus much, however, appears certain, that the commentaries\n",
      "are rather those of an habitual play-goer, than of a studious critic; and it will be easy to\n",

      "\n",
      "The chief, perhaps the only, commendation of these chapters is that they pretend to no final\n",
      "solution of the problem which they discuss. How to assert the eternal and objective reality\n",
      "of that Presence, the consciousness of Whom is alike the beginning and the end, the motive\n",
      "and the reward, of the religious experience, is not altogether clear in an age that, for over\n",
      "two centuries, has more and more rejected the transcendental ideas of the human understanding.\n",
      "Yet the consequences of that rejection, in the increasing individualism of conduct which has\n",
      "kept pace with the growing subjectivism of thought, are now sufficiently apparent and the present\n",
      "plight of our civilization is already leading its more characteristic members, the political\n",
      "scientists and the economists, to reÃ«xamine and reappraise the concepts upon which it is founded.\n",
      "It is a similar attempt to scrutinize and evaluate the significant aspects of the interdependent\n",
      "thought and conduct of our day from the standpoint of religion which is here attempted. Its\n",
      "sole and modest purpose is to endeavor to restore some neglected emphases, to recall to spiritually\n",
      "minded men and women certain half-forgotten values in the religious experience and to add such\n",
      "observations regarding them as may, by good fortune, contribute something to that future reconciling\n",
      "of the thought currents and value judgments of our day to these central and precious facts\n",

      "The first difficulty which confronts the incumbent of the Lyman Beecher Foundation, after he\n",
      "has accepted the appalling fact that he must hitch his modest wagon, not merely to a star,\n",
      "but rather to an entire constellation, is the delimitation of his subject. There are many inquiries,\n",
      "none of them without significance, with which he might appropriately concern himself. For not\n",
      "only is the profession of the Christian ministry a many-sided one, but scales of value change\n",
      "and emphases shift, within the calling itself, with our changing civilization. The mediaeval\n",
      "world brought forth, out of its need, the robed and mitered ecclesiastic; a more recent world,\n",
      "pursuant to its genius, demanded the ethical idealist. Drink-sodden Georgian England responded\n",
      "to the open-air evangelism of Whitefield and Wesley; the next century found the Established\n",
      "Church divided against itself by the learning and culture of the Oxford Movement. Sometimes\n",
      "a philosopher and theologian, like Edwards, initiates the Great Awakening; sometimes an emotional\n",
      "mystic like Bernard can arouse all Europe and carry men, tens of thousands strong, over the\n",
      "Danube and over the Hellespont to die for the Cross upon the burning sands of Syria; sometimes\n",
      "it is the George Herberts, in a hundred rural parishes, who make grace to abound through the\n",
      "intimate and precious ministrations of the country parson. Let us, therefore, devote this chapter\n",
      "to a review of the several aspects of the Christian ministry, in order to set in its just perspective\n",
      "the one which we have chosen for these discussions and to see why it seems to stand, for the\n",
      "moment, in the forefront of importance. Our immediate question is, Who, on the whole, is the\n",
      "most needed figure in the ministry today? Is it the professional ecclesiastic, backed with\n",
      "the authority and prestige of a venerable organization? Is it the curate of souls, patient\n",
      "shepherd of the silly sheep? Is it the theologian, the administrator, the prophet--who?\n",
      "\n",
      "One might think profitably on that first question in these very informal days. We are witnessing\n",
      "a breakdown of all external forms of authority which, while salutary and necessary, is also\n",
      "perilous. Not many of us err, just now, by overmagnifying our official status. Many of us instead\n",
      "are terribly at ease in Zion and might become less assured and more significant by undertaking\n",
      "the subjective task of a study in ministerial personality. \"What we are,\" to paraphrase Emerson,\n",
      "\"speaks so loud that men cannot hear what we say.\" Every great calling has its characteristic\n",
      "mental attitude, the unwritten code of honor of the group, without a knowledge of which one\n",
      "could scarcely be an efficient or honorable practitioner within it. One of the perplexing and\n",
      "irritating problems of the personal life of the preacher today has to do with the collision\n",
      "between the secular standards of his time, this traditional code of his class, and the requirements\n",
      "of his faith. Shall he acquiesce in the smug conformities, the externalized procedures of average\n",
      "society, somewhat pietized, and join that large company of good and ordinary people, of whom\n",
      "Samuel Butler remarks, in The Way of All Flesh, that they would be \"equally horrified at hearing\n",
      "the Christian religion doubted, or at seeing it practised?\" There are ministers who do thus\n",
      "content themselves with being merely superrespectable. Shall he exalt the standards of his\n",
      "calling, accentuate the speech and dress, the code and manners of his group, the historic statements\n",
      "of his faith, at the risk of becoming an official, a \"professional\"? Or does he possess the\n",
      "insight, and can he acquire the courage, to follow men like Francis of Assisi or Father Damien\n",
      "and adopt the Christian ethic and thus join that company of the apostles and martyrs whose\n",
      "blood is the seed of the church? A good deal might be said today on the need of this sort of\n",
      "personal culture in the ministerial candidate. But, provocative and significant though the\n",
      "question is, it is too limited in scope, too purely subjective in nature, to suit the character\n",
      "and the urgency of the needs of this moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, every profession has the prized inheritance of its own particular and gradually perfected\n",
      "human skill. An interesting study, then, would be the analysis of that rich content of human\n",
      "insights, the result of generations of pastoral experience, which form the background of all\n",
      "great preaching. No man, whether learned or pious, or both, is equipped for the pulpit without\n",
      "the addition of that intuitive discernment, that quick and varied appreciation, that sane and\n",
      "tolerant knowledge of life and the world, which is the reward given to the friends and lovers\n",
      "of mankind. For the preacher deals not with the shallows but the depths of life. Like his Master\n",
      "he must be a great humanist. To make real sermons he has to look, without dismay or evasion,\n",
      "far into the heart's impenetrable recesses. He must have had some experience with the absolutism\n",
      "of both good and evil. I think preachers who regard sermons on salvation as superfluous have\n",
      "not had much experience with either. They belong to that large world of the intermediates,\n",
      "neither positively good nor bad, who compose the mass of the prosperous and respectable in\n",
      "our genteel civilization. Since they belong to it they cannot lead it. And certainly they who\n",
      "do not know the absolutism of evil cannot very well understand sinners. Genuine satans, as\n",
      "Milton knew, are not weaklings and traitors who have declined from the standards of a respectable\n",
      "civilization. They are positive and impressive figures pursuing and acting up to their own\n",
      "ideal of conduct, not fleeing from self-accepted retribution or falling away from a confessed\n",
      "morality of ours. Evil is a force even more than a folly; it is a positive agent busily building\n",
      "away at the City of Dreadful Night, constructing its insolent and scoffing society within the\n",
      "very precincts of the City of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must know, then, that evil and suffering are not temporary elements of man's evolution,\n",
      "just about to be eliminated by the new reform, the last formula, the fresh panacea. To those\n",
      "who have tasted grief and smelt the fire such easy preaching and such confident solutions are\n",
      "a grave offense. They know that evil is an integral part of our universe; suffering an enduring\n",
      "element of the whole. So he must preach upon the chances and changes of this mortal world,\n",
      "or go to the house of shame or the place of mourning, knowing that there is something past\n",
      "finding out in evil, something incommunicable about true sorrow. They are not external things,\n",
      "alien to our natures, that happen one day from without, and may perhaps be avoided, and by\n",
      "and by are gone. No; that which makes sorrow, sorrow, and evil, evil, is their naturalness;\n",
      "they well up from within, part of the very texture of our consciousness. He knows you can never\n",
      "express them, for truly to do that you would have to express and explain the entire world.\n",
      "It is not easy then to interpret the evil and suffering which are not external and temporary,\n",
      "but enduring and a part of the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the preacher is never dealing with plain or uncomplicated matters. It is his business to\n",
      "perceive the mystery of iniquity in the saint and to recognize the mystery of godliness in\n",
      "the sinner. It is his business to revere the child and yet watch him that he may make a man\n",
      "of him. He must say, so as to be understood, to those who balk at discipline, and rail at self-repression,\n",
      "and resent pain: you have not yet begun to live nor made the first step toward understanding\n",
      "the universe and yourselves. To avoid discipline and to blench at pain is to evade life. There\n",
      "are limitations, occasioned by the evil and the suffering of the world, in whose repressions\n",
      "men find fulfillment. When you are honest with yourself you will know what Dante meant when\n",
      "he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"And thou shalt see those who\n",
      "  Contented are within the fire;\n",
      "  Because they hope to come,\n",
      "  When e'er it may be, to the blessed people.\"[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is his business, also, to be the comrade of his peers, and yet speak to them the truth in\n",
      "love; his task to understand the bitterness and assuage the sorrows of old age. I suppose the\n",
      "greatest influence a preacher ever exercises, and a chief source of the material and insight\n",
      "of his preaching, is found in this intimate contact with living and suffering, divided and\n",
      "distracted men and women. When strong men blench with pain and exquisite grief stirs within\n",
      "us at the sight and we can endure naught else but to suffer with them, when youth is blurred\n",
      "with sin, and gray heads are sick with shame and we, then, want to die and cry, O God! forgive\n",
      "and save them or else blot me out of Thy book of life--for who could bear to live in a world\n",
      "where such things are the end!--then, through the society of sorrow, and the holy comradeship\n",
      "in shame, we begin to find the Lord and to understand both the kindness and the justice of\n",
      "His world. In the moment when sympathy takes the bitterness out of another's sorrow and my\n",
      "suffering breaks the captivity of my neighbor's sin--then, when because \"together,\" with sinner\n",
      "and sufferer, we come out into the quiet land of freedom and of peace, we perceive how the\n",
      "very heart of God, upon which there we know we rest, may be found in the vicarious suffering\n",
      "and sacrifice called forth by the sorrow and the evil of mankind. Then we can preach the Gospel.\n",
      "Because then we dimly understand why men have hung their God upon the Cross of Christ!\n",
      "\n",
      "[Footnote 1: The Divine Comedy: Hell; canto I.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not ludicrous, then, to suppose that a man merely equipped with professional scholarship,\n",
      "or contented with moral conformities, can minister to the sorrow and the mystery, the mingled\n",
      "shame and glory of a human being? This is why the average theologue, in his first parish, is\n",
      "like the well-meaning but meddling engineer endeavoring with clumsy tools and insensitive fingers\n",
      "to adjust the delicate and complicated mechanism of a Genevan watch. And here is one of the\n",
      "real reasons why we deprecate men entering our calling, without both the culture of a liberal\n",
      "education and the learning of a graduate school. Clearly, therefore, one real task of such\n",
      "schools and their lectureships is to offer men wide and gracious training in the art of human\n",
      "contacts, so that their lives may be lifted above Pharisaism and moral self-consciousness,\n",
      "made acquainted with the higher and comprehensive interpretations of the heart and mind of\n",
      "our race. For only thus can they approach life reverently and humbly. Only thus will they revere\n",
      "the integrity of the human spirit; only thus can they regard it with a magnanimous and catholic\n",
      "understanding and measure it not by the standards of temperamental or sectarian convictions,\n",
      "but by what is best and highest, deepest and holiest in the race. No one needs more than the\n",
      "young preacher to be drawn out of the range of narrow judgments, of exclusive standards and\n",
      "ecclesiastical traditions and to be flung out among free and sensitive spirits, that he may\n",
      "watch their workings, master their perceptions, catch their scale of values.\n",
      "\n",
      "A discussion, then, dealing with this aspect of our problem, would raise many and genuine questions\n",
      "for us. There is the more room for it in this time of increasing emphasis upon machinery when\n",
      "even ministers are being measured in the terms of power, speed and utility. These are not real\n",
      "ends of life; real ends are unity, repose, the imaginative and spiritual values which make\n",
      "for the release of self, with its by-product of happiness. In such days, then, when the old-time\n",
      "pastor-preacher is becoming as rare as the former general practitioner; when the lines of division\n",
      "between speaker, educator, expert in social hygiene, are being sharply drawn--as though new\n",
      "methods insured of themselves fresh inspiration, and technical knowledge was identical with\n",
      "spiritual understanding--it would be worth while to dwell upon the culture of the pastoral\n",
      "office and to show that ingenuity is not yet synonymous with insight, and that, in our profession\n",
      "at least, card-catalogues cannot take the place of the personal study of the human heart. But\n",
      "many discussions on this Foundation, and recently those of Dr. Jowett, have already dealt with\n",
      "this sort of analysis. Besides, today, when not merely the preacher, but the very view of the\n",
      "world that produced him, is being threatened with temporary extinction, such a theme, poetic\n",
      "and rewarding though it is, becomes irrelevant and parochial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or we might turn to the problem of technique, that professional equipment for his task as a\n",
      "sermonizer and public speaker which is partly a native endowment and partly a laborious acquisition\n",
      "on the preacher's part. Such was President Tucker's course on The Making and Unmaking of the\n",
      "Preacher. Certainly observations on professional technique, especially if they should include,\n",
      "like his, acute discussion of the speaker's obligation to honesty of thinking, no less than\n",
      "integrity of conduct; of the immorality of the pragmatic standard of mere effectiveness or\n",
      "immediate efficiency in the selection of material; of the aesthetic folly and ethical dubiety\n",
      "of simulated extempore speaking and genuinely impromptu prayers, would not be superfluous.\n",
      "But, on the other hand, we may hope to accomplish much of this indirectly today. Because there\n",
      "is no way of handling specifically either the content of the Christian message or the problem\n",
      "of the immediate needs and temper of those to whom it is to be addressed, without reference\n",
      "to the kind of personality, and the nature of the tools at his disposal, which is best suited\n",
      "to commend the one and to interpret the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence such a discussion as this ought, by its very scale of values--by the motives that inform\n",
      "it and the ends that determine it--to condemn thereby the insincere and artificial speaker,\n",
      "or that pseudo-sermon which is neither as exposition, an argument nor a meditation but a mosaic,\n",
      "a compilation of other men's thoughts, eked out by impossibly impressive or piously sentimental\n",
      "anecdotes, the whole glued together by platitudes of the Martin Tupper or Samuel Smiles variety.\n",
      "It is certainly an obvious but greatly neglected truth that simplicity and candor in public\n",
      "speaking, largeness of mental movement, what Phillips Brooks called direct utterance of comprehensive\n",
      "truths, are indispensable prerequisites for any significant ethical or spiritual leadership.\n",
      "But, taken as a main theme, this third topic, like the others, seems to me insufficiently inclusive\n",
      "to meet our present exigencies. It deals more with the externals than with the heart of our\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again we might address ourselves to the ethical and practical aspects of preaching and the\n",
      "ministry. Taking largely for granted our understanding of the Gospel, we might concern ourselves\n",
      "with its relations to society, the detailed implications for the moral and economic problems\n",
      "of our social and industrial order. Dean Brown, in The Social Message of the Modern Pulpit,\n",
      "and Dr. Coffin in In a Day of Social Rebuilding, have so enriched this Foundation. Moreover,\n",
      "this is, at the moment, an almost universally popular treatment of the preacher's opportunity\n",
      "and obligation. One reason, therefore, for not choosing this approach to our task is that the\n",
      "preacher's attention, partly because of the excellence of these and other books and lectures,\n",
      "and partly because of the acuteness of the political-industrial crisis which is now upon us,\n",
      "is already focused upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, our present moment is changing with an ominous rapidity. And one is not sure whether\n",
      "the immediate situation, as distinguished from that of even a few years ago, calls us to be\n",
      "concerned chiefly with the practical and ethical aspects of our mission, urgent though the\n",
      "need and critical the pass, to which the abuses of the capitalistic system have brought both\n",
      "European and American society. In this day of those shifting standards which mark the gradual\n",
      "transference of power from one group to another in the community, and the merging of a spent\n",
      "epoch in a new order, neither the chief opportunity nor the most serious peril of religious\n",
      "leadership is met by fresh and energetic programs of religion in action. In such days, our\n",
      "chief gift to the world cannot be the support of any particular reforms or the alliance with\n",
      "any immediate ethical or economic movement. For these things at best would be merely the effects\n",
      "of religion. And it is not religion in its relations, nor even in its expression in character--it\n",
      "is the thing in itself that this age most needs. What men are chiefly asking of life at this\n",
      "moment is not, What ought we to do? but the deeper question, What is there we can believe?\n",
      "For they know that the answer to this question would show us what we ought to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor do our reform alliances and successive programs and crusades always seem to me to proceed\n",
      "from any careful estimate of the situation as a whole or to be conceived in the light of comprehensive\n",
      "Christian principle. Instead, they sometimes seem to draw their inspiration more from the sense\n",
      "of the urgent need of presenting to an indifferent or disillusioned world some quick and tangible\n",
      "evidence of a continuing moral vigor and spiritual passion to which the deeper and more potent\n",
      "witnesses are absent. It is as though we thought the machinery of the church would revolve\n",
      "with more energy if geared into the wheels of the working world. But that world and we do not\n",
      "draw our power from the same dynamo. And surely in a day of profound and widespread mental\n",
      "ferment and moral restlessness, some more fundamental gift than this is asked of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, therefore, these chapters pay only an incidental attention to the church's social and ethical\n",
      "message, it is partly because our attention is, at this very moment, largely centered upon\n",
      "this important, yet secondary matter, and more because there lies beneath it a yet more urgent\n",
      "and inclusive task which confronts the spokesman of organized religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will expect me then to say that we are to turn to some speculative and philosophic study,\n",
      "such as the analysis of the Christian idea in its world relationships, some fresh statement\n",
      "of the Gospel, either by way of apologia for inherited concepts, or as attempting to make a\n",
      "new receptacle for the living wine, which has indeed burst the most of its ancient bottles.\n",
      "Such was Principal Fairbairn's monumental task in The Place of Christ in Modern Theology and\n",
      "also Dr. Gordon's in his distinguished discussions in The Ultimate Conceptions of Faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, certainly, is an endeavor which is always of primary importance. There is an abiding\n",
      "peril, forever crouching at the door of ancient organizations, that they shall seek refuge\n",
      "from the difficulties of thought in the opportunities of action. They need to be continually\n",
      "reminded that reforms begin in the same place where abuses do, namely, in the notion of things;\n",
      "that only just ideas can, in the long run, purify conduct; that clear thinking is the source\n",
      "of all high and sustained feeling. I wish that we might essay the philosopher-theologian's\n",
      "task. This generation is hungry for understanding; it perishes for lack of knowledge. One reason\n",
      "for the indubitable decline of the preacher's power is that we have been culpably indifferent\n",
      "in maintaining close and friendly alliances between the science and the art, the teachers and\n",
      "the practitioners of religion. Few things would be more ominous than to permit any further\n",
      "widening of the gulf which already exists between these two. Never more than now does the preacher\n",
      "need to be reminded of what Marcus Aurelius said: \"Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such\n",
      "also shall be thyself; for the soul is dyed by its thoughts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But such an undertaking, calling for wide and exact scholarship, large reserves of extra-professional\n",
      "learning, does not primarily belong to a discussion within the department of practical theology.\n",
      "Besides which there is a task, closely allied to it, but creative rather than critical, prophetic\n",
      "rather than philosophic, which does fall within the precise area of this field. I mean the\n",
      "endeavor to describe the mind and heart of our generation, appraise the significant thought-currents\n",
      "of our time. This would be an attempt to give some description of the chief impulses fermenting\n",
      "in contemporary society, to ask what relation they hold to the Christian principle, and to\n",
      "inquire what attitude toward them our preaching should adopt. If it be true that what is most\n",
      "revealing in any age is its regulative ideas, then what is more valuable for the preacher than\n",
      "to attempt the understanding of his generation through the defining of its ruling concepts?\n",
      "And it is this audacious task which, for two reasons, we shall presume to undertake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason is that it is appropriate both to the temperament and the training of the\n",
      "preacher. There are three grand divisions, or rather determining emphases, by which men may\n",
      "be separated into vocational groups. To begin with, there is the man of the scientific or intellectual\n",
      "type. He has a passion for facts and a strong sense of their reality. He moves with natural\n",
      "ease among abstract propositions, is both critical of, and fertile in, theories; indicates\n",
      "his essential distinction in his love of the truth for the truth's sake. He looks first to\n",
      "the intrinsic reasonableness of any proposition; tends to judge both men and movements not\n",
      "by traditional or personal values, but by a detached and disinterested appraisal of their inherent\n",
      "worth. He is often a dogmatist, but this fault is not peculiar to him, he shares it with the\n",
      "rest of mankind. He is sometimes a literalist and sometimes a slave to logic, more concerned\n",
      "with combating the crude or untenable form of a proposition than inquiring with sympathetic\n",
      "insight into the worth of its substance. But these things are perversions of his excellencies,\n",
      "defects of his virtues. His characteristic qualities are mental integrity, accuracy of statement,\n",
      "sanity of judgment, capacity for sustained intellectual toil. Such men are investigators, scholars;\n",
      "when properly blended with the imaginative type they become inventors and teachers. They make\n",
      "good theologians and bad preachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are the practical men, beloved of our American life. Both their feet are firmly\n",
      "fixed upon the solid ground. They generally know just where they are, which is not surprising,\n",
      "for they do not, for the most part, either in the world of mind or spirit, frequent unusual\n",
      "places. The finespun speculations of the philosophers and the impractical dreams of the artist\n",
      "make small appeal to them; the world they live in is a sharply defined and clearly lighted\n",
      "and rather limited place. They like to say to this man come and he cometh, and to that man\n",
      "go and he goeth. They are enamored of offices, typewriters, telegrams, long-distance messages,\n",
      "secretaries, programs, conferences and drives. Getting results is their goal; everything is\n",
      "judged by the criterion of effective action; they are instinctive and unconscious pragmatists.\n",
      "They make good cheer leaders at football games in their youth and impressive captains of industry\n",
      "in their old age. Their virtues are wholesome, if obvious; they are good mixers, have shrewd\n",
      "judgment, immense physical and volitional energy. They understand that two and two make four.\n",
      "They are rarely saints but, unlike many of us who once had the capacity for sainthood, they\n",
      "are not dreadful sinners. They are the tribe of which politicians are born but, when they are\n",
      "blended with imaginative and spiritual gifts, they become philanthropists and statesmen, practical\n",
      "servants of mankind. They make good, if conservative, citizens; kind, if uninspiring, husbands\n",
      "and deplorable preachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are those fascinating men of feeling and imagination, those who look into their\n",
      "own hearts and write, those to whom the inner dominions which the spirit conquers for itself\n",
      "become a thousand-fold more real than the earth whereon they stamp their feet. These are the\n",
      "literary or the creative folk. Their passion is not so much to know life as to enjoy it; not\n",
      "to direct it, but to experience it; not even to make understanding of it an end, but only a\n",
      "means to interpreting it. They do not, as a rule, thirst for erudition, and they are indifferent\n",
      "to those manipulations of the externals of life which are dear to the lovers of executive power.\n",
      "They know less but they understand more than their scholastic brethren. As a class they are\n",
      "sometimes disreputable but nearly always unworldly; more distinguished by an intuitive and\n",
      "childlike than by an ingenious or sophisticated quality of mind. Ideas and facts are perceived\n",
      "by them not abstractly nor practically, but in their typical or symbolic, hence their pictorial\n",
      "and transmissible, aspects. They read dogma, whether theological or other, in the terms of\n",
      "a living process, unconsciously translating it, as they go along, out of its cold propositions\n",
      "into its appropriate forms of feeling and needs and satisfactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientist, then, is a critic, a learner who wants to analyze and dissect; the man of affairs\n",
      "is a director and builder and wants to command and construct; the man of this group is a seer.\n",
      "He is a lover and a dreamer; he watches and broods over life, profoundly feeling it, enamored\n",
      "both of its shame and of its glory. The intolerable poignancy of existence is bittersweet to\n",
      "his mouth; he craves to incarnate, to interpret its entire human process, always striving to\n",
      "pierce to its center, to capture and express its inexpressible ultimate. He is an egotist but\n",
      "a valuable one, acutely aware of the depths and immensities of his own spirit and of its significant\n",
      "relations to this seething world without. Thus it is both himself and a new vision of life,\n",
      "in terms of himself, that he desires to project for his community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The form of that vision will vary according to the nature of the tools, the selection of material,\n",
      "the particular sort of native endowment which are given to him. Some such men reveal their\n",
      "understanding of the soul and the world in the detached serenity, the too well-defined harmonies\n",
      "of a Parthenon; others in the dim and intricate richness, the confused and tortured aspiration\n",
      "of the long-limbed saints and grotesque devils of a Gothic cathedral. Others incarnate it in\n",
      "gleaming bronze; or spread it in subtle play of light and shade and tones of color on a canvas;\n",
      "or write it in great plays which open the dark chambers of the soul and make the heart stand\n",
      "still; or sing it in sweet and terrible verse, full-throated utterance of man's pride and hope\n",
      "and passion. Some act it before the altar or beneath the proscenium arch; some speak it, now\n",
      "in Cassandra-tones, now comfortably like shepherds of frail sheep. These folk are the brothers-in-blood,\n",
      "the fellow craftsmen of the preacher. By a silly convention, he is almost forbidden to consult\n",
      "with them, and to betake himself to the learned, the respectable and the dull. But it is with\n",
      "these that naturally he sees eye to eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, in calling the preacher a prophet we mean that preaching is an art and the preacher\n",
      "is an artist; for all great art has the prophetic quality. Many men object to this definition\n",
      "of the preacher as being profane. It appears to make secular or mechanicalize their profession,\n",
      "to rob preaching of its sacrosanctity, leave it less authority by making it more intelligible,\n",
      "remove it from the realm of the mystical and unique. This objection seems to me sometimes an\n",
      "expression of spiritual arrogance and sometimes a subtle form of skepticism. It assumes a special\n",
      "privilege for our profession or a not-get-at-able defense and sanction by insisting that it\n",
      "differs in origin and hence in kind from similar expressions of the human spirit. It hesitates\n",
      "to rely on the normal and the intelligible sources of ministerial power, to confess the relatively\n",
      "definable origin and understandable methods of our work. It fears to trust to these alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all these must be trusted. We may safely assert that the preacher deals with absolute values,\n",
      "for all art does that. But we may not assert that he is the only person that does so or that\n",
      "his is the only or the unapproachable way. No; he, too, is an artist. Hence, a sermon is not\n",
      "a contribution to, but an interpretation of, knowledge, made in terms of the religious experience.\n",
      "It is taking truth out of its compressed and abstract form, its impersonal and scientific language,\n",
      "and returning it to life in the terms of the ethical and spiritual experience of mankind, thus\n",
      "giving it such concrete and pictorial expression that it stimulates the imagination and moves\n",

      "\n",
      "It will be clear then why I have said that the task of appraising the heart and mind of our\n",
      "generation, to which we address ourselves, is appropriate to the preaching genius. For only\n",
      "they could attempt such a task who possess an informed and disciplined yet essentially intuitive\n",
      "spirit with its scale of values; who by instinct can see their age as a whole and indicate\n",
      "its chief emphases, its controlling tendencies, its significant expressions. It is not the\n",
      "scientist but the seer who thus attempts the precious but perilous task of making the great\n",
      "generalizations. This is what Aristotle means when he says, \"The poet ranks higher than the\n",
      "historian because he achieves a more general truth.\" This is, I suppose, what Houston Stewart\n",
      "Chamberlain means when he says, in the introduction to the Foundations of the Nineteenth Century:\n",
      "\"our modern world represents an immeasurable array of facts. The mastery of such a task as\n",
      "recording and interpreting them scientifically is impossible. It is only the genius of the\n",
      "artist, which feels the secret parallels that exist between the world of vision and of thought,\n",
      "that can, if fortune be favorable, reveal the unity beneath the immeasurable complexities and\n",
      "diversities of the present order.\" Or as Professor Hocking says: \"The prophet must find in\n",
      "the current of history a unity corresponding to the unity of the physical universe, or else\n",
      "he must create it. It is this conscious unification of history that the religious will spontaneously\n",

      "It is then precisely the preacher's task, his peculiar office, to attempt these vast and perilous\n",
      "summations. What he is set here for is to bring the immeasurable within the scope of vision.\n",
      "He deals with the far-flung outposts, no man knows how distant, and the boundless interspaces\n",
      "of human consciousness; he deals with the beginning, the middle, the end--the origin, the meaning\n",
      "and the destiny--of human life. How can anyone give unity to such a prospect? Like any other\n",
      "artist he gives it the only unity possible, the unity revealed in his own personality. The\n",
      "theologian should not attempt to evaluate his age; the preacher may. Because the theologian,\n",
      "like any other scientist, analyzes and dissects; he breaks up the world. The preacher in his\n",
      "disciplined imagination, his spiritual intuitiveness,--what we call the \"religious temperament,\"--unites\n",
      "it again and makes men see it whole. This quality of purified and enlightened imagination is\n",

      "into one of the world's transition epochs, he speaks in an hour which is radical in changes,\n",
      "perplexing in its multifarious cross-currents, prolific of new forms and expressions. What\n",
      "the world most needs at such a moment of expansion and rebellion, is a redefining of its ideals.\n",

      "Indeed, I am convinced that a chief reason why preaching is temporarily obscured in power,\n",
      "is because most of our expertness in it is in terms of local problems, of partial significances,\n",
      "rather than in the wider tendencies that produce and carry them, or in the ultimate laws of\n",
      "conduct which should govern them. We ought to be troubled, I think, in our present ecclesiastical\n",

      "There remains but one thing more to be accomplished in this chapter. The problem of the selection\n",

      "devices I have taken as the framework on which to hang these discussions three familiar divisions\n",
      "of thought and feeling, with their accompanying laws of conduct, and value judgments. They\n",
      "are the humanistic or classic; the naturalistic or primitive; and the religious or transcendent\n",
      "interpretation of the world and life. One sets up a social, one an individual, and one a universal\n",

      "analysis of them, contrasting their general attitudes, may serve as a fit introduction to the\n",
      "ensuing chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We begin, then, with the humanist. He is the man who ignores, as unnecessary, any direct reference\n",
      "to, or connection with, ultimate or supernatural values. He lives in a high but self-contained\n",
      "world. His is man's universe. His law is the law of reasonable self-discipline, founded on\n",
      "observation of nature and a respect for social values, and buttressed by high human pride.\n",
      "He accepts the authority of the collective experience of his generation or his race. He believes,\n",
      "centrally, in the trustworthiness of human nature, in its group capacity. Men, as a race, have\n",
      "intelligently observed and experimented with both themselves and the world about them. Out\n",
      "of centuries of critical reflection and sad and wise endeavor, they have evolved certain criteria\n",
      "of experience. These summations could hardly be called eternal laws but they are standards;\n",
      "they are the permits and prohibitions for human life. Some of them affect personal conduct\n",
      "and are moral standards; some of them affect civil government and are political axioms; some\n",
      "of them affect production and distribution and are economic laws; some of them affect social\n",
      "relationships. But in every case the humanist has what is, in a sense, an objective because\n",
      "a formal standard; he looks without himself as an individual, yet to himself as a part of the\n",
      "composite experience and wisdom of his race, for understanding and for guides. Thus the individual\n",
      "conforms to the needs and wisdom of the group. Humanism, at its best, has something heroic,\n",
      "unselfish, noble about it. Its votaries do not eat to their liking nor drink to their thirst.\n",
      "They learn deep lessons almost unconsciously; to conquer their desires, to make light of toil\n",
      "and pain and discomfort; the true humanist is well aware that Spartan discipline is incomparably\n",
      "superior to Greek accidence. This is what one of the greatest of them, Goethe, meant when he\n",
      "said: \"Anything which emancipates the spirit without a corresponding growth in self-mastery\n",
      "is pernicious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All humanists then have two characteristics in common: first, they assume that man is his own\n",
      "arbiter, has both the requisite intelligence and the moral ability to control his own destiny;\n",
      "secondly, they place the source and criterion of this power in collective wisdom, not in individual\n",
      "vagary and not in divine revelation. They assert, therefore, that the law of the group, the\n",
      "perfected and wrought out code of human experience, is all that is binding and all that is\n",
      "essential. To be sure, and most significantly, this authority is not rigid, complete, fixed.\n",
      "There is nothing complete in the humanist's world. Experience accumulates and man's knowledge\n",
      "grows; the expectation and joy in progress is a part of it; man's code changes, emends, expands\n",
      "with his onward marching. But the humanistic point of view assumes something relatively stable\n",
      "in life. Hence our phrase that humanism gives us a classic, that is to say, a simple and established\n",
      "standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be observed that there is nothing in humanism thus defined which need be incompatible\n",
      "with religion. It is not with its content but its incompleteness that we quarrel. Indeed, in\n",
      "its assertion of the trustworthiness of human experience, its faith in the dignity and significance\n",
      "of man, its respect for the interests of the group, and its conviction that man finds his true\n",
      "self only outside his immediate physical person, beyond his material wants and desires, it\n",
      "is quite genuinely a part of the religious understanding. But we shall have occasion to observe\n",
      "that while much of this may be religious this is not the whole of religion. For the note of\n",
      "universality is absent. Humanism is essentially aristocratic. It is for a selected group that\n",
      "it is practicable and it is a selected experience upon which it rests. Its standards are esoteric\n",
      "rather than democratic. Yet it is hardly necessary to point out the immense part which humanism,\n",
      "as thus defined, is playing in present life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another law which, from remotest times, man has followed whenever he dared. It\n",
      "is not the law of the group but of the individual, not the law of civilization but of the jungle.\n",
      "\"Most men,\" says Aristotle, \"would rather live in a disorderly than a sober manner.\" He means\n",
      "that most men would rather consult and gratify their immediate will, their nearest choices,\n",
      "their instantaneous desires, than conform the moment to some regulated and considerate, some\n",
      "comprehensive scheme of life and action. The life of unreason is their desire; the experience\n",
      "whose bent is determined by every whim, the expression which has no rational connection with\n",
      "the past and no serious consideration for the future. This is of the very essence of lawlessness\n",
      "because it is revolt against the normal sequence of law and effect, in mind and conduct, in\n",
      "favor of untrammeled adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is naturalism or paganism as we often call it. Naturalism is a perversion of that\n",
      "high instinct in mankind which issues in the old concept of supernaturalism. The supernaturalist,\n",
      "of a former and discredited type, believed that God violates the order of nature for sublime\n",
      "ends; that He \"breaks into\" His own world, so to speak, \"revealing\" Himself in prodigious,\n",
      "inexplicable, arbitrary ways. By a sort of degradation of this notion, a perversion of this\n",
      "instinct, the naturalist assumes that he can violate both the human and the divine law for\n",
      "personal ends, and express himself in fantastic or indecent or impious ways. The older supernaturalism\n",
      "exalts the individualism of the Creator; naturalism the egotism of the creature. I make the\n",
      "contrast not merely to excoriate naturalism, but to point out the interdependence between man's\n",
      "apparently far-separated expressions of his spirit, and how subtly misleading are our highly\n",
      "prized distinctions, how dangerous sometimes that secondary mental power which multiplies them.\n",
      "It sobers and clarifies human thinking a little, perhaps, to reflect on how thin a line separates\n",
      "the sublime and the ridiculous, the saint and the sensualist, the martyr and the fool, the\n",
      "genius and the freak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with this selfish individualism which we call naturalism we shall have much to do, for\n",
      "it plays an increasing rÃ´le in the modern world; it is the neo-paganism which we may see spreading\n",
      "about us. Sophistries of all kinds become the powerful allies of this sort of moral and aesthetic\n",
      "anarchy. Its votaries are those sorts of rebels who invariably make their minds not their friends\n",
      "but their accomplices. They are ingenious in the art of letting themselves go and at the same\n",
      "time thinking themselves controlled and praiseworthy. The naturalist, then, ignores the group;\n",
      "he flaunts impartially both the classic and the religious law. He is equally unwilling to submit\n",
      "to a power imposed from above and without, or to accept those restrictions of society, self-imposed\n",
      "by man's own codified and corrected observations of the natural world and his own impulses.\n",
      "He jeers at the one as hypocrisy and superstition and at the other as mere \"middle-class respectability.\"\n",
      "He himself is the perpetual Ajax standing defiant upon the headland of his own inflamed desires,\n",
      "and scoffing at the lightnings either of heaven or society. Neither devoutness nor progress\n",
      "but mere personal expansion is his goal. The humanist curbs both the flesh and the imagination\n",
      "by a high doctrine of expediency. Natural values are always critically appraised in the light\n",
      "of humane values, which is nearly, if not quite, the same as saying that the individual desires\n",
      "and delights must be conformed to the standards of the group. There can be no anarchy of the\n",
      "imagination, no license of the mind, no unbridled will. Humanism, no less than religion, is\n",
      "nobly, though not so deeply, traditional. But there is no tradition to the naturalist; not\n",
      "the normal and representative, but the unique and spectacular is his goal. Novelty and expansion,\n",
      "not form and proportion, are his goddesses. Not truth and duty, but instinct and appetite,\n",
      "are in the saddle. He will try any horrid experiment from which he may derive a new sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over against them both stands the man of religion with his vision of the whole and his consequent\n",
      "law of proud humility. The next three chapters will try to discuss in detail these several\n",

      "\n",
      "We are not using the term \"humanism\" in this chapter in its strictly technical sense. Because\n",
      "we are not concerned with the history of thought merely, but also with its practical embodiments\n",
      "in various social organizations as well. So we mean by \"humanism\" not only those modes and\n",
      "systems of thought in which human interests predominate but also the present economic, political\n",
      "and ecclesiastical institutions which more or less consistently express them. Hence, the term\n",
      "as used will include concepts not always agreeing with each other, and sometimes only semi-related\n",
      "to the main stream of the movement. This need not trouble us. Strict intellectual consistency\n",
      "is a fascinating and impossible goal of probably dubious value. Moreover, it is this whole\n",
      "expression of the time spirit which bathes the sensitive personality of the preacher, persuading\n",
      "and moulding him quite as much by its derived and concrete manifestations in contemporary society\n",
      "as by its essential and abstract principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are then two sets of media through which humanism has affected preaching. The first are\n",
      "philosophical and find their expression in a large body of literature which has been moulding\n",
      "thought and feeling for nearly four centuries. Humanism begins with the general abstract assumption\n",
      "that all which men can know, or need to know, are \"natural\" and human values; that they have\n",
      "no means of getting outside the inexorable circle of their own experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much, of course, depends here upon the sense in which the word \"experience\" is used. The assumption\n",
      "need not necessarily be challenged except where, as is very often the case, an arbitrarily\n",
      "limited definition of experience is intended. From this general assumption flows the subjective\n",
      "theory of morals; from it is derived the conviction that the rationalistic values in religion\n",
      "are the only real, or at least demonstrable, ones; and hence from this comes the shifting of\n",
      "the seat of religious authority from \"revelation\" to experience. In so far as this is a correction\n",
      "of emphasis only, or the abandonment of a misleading term rather than the denial of one of\n",
      "the areas and modes of understanding, again we have no quarrel with it. But if it means an\n",
      "exclusion of the supersensuous sources of knowledge or the denial of the existence of absolute\n",
      "values as the source of our relative and subjective understanding, then it strikes at the heart\n",
      "of religion. Because the religious life is built on those factors of experience that lie above\n",
      "the strictly rational realm of consciousness just as the pagan view rests on primitive instincts\n",
      "that lie beneath it. Of course, in asserting the importance of these \"supersensuous\" values\n",
      "the religionist does not mean that they are beyond the reach of human appraisal or unrelated\n",
      "by their nature to the rest of our understanding. By the intuitive he does not mean the uncritical\n",
      "nor by the supersensuous the supernatural in the old and discredited sense of an arbitrary\n",
      "and miraculous revelation. Mysticism is not superstition, nor are the insights of the poet\n",
      "the whimsies of the mere impressionist. But he insists that the humanist, in his ordinary definition\n",
      "of experience, ignores or denies these superrational values. In opposition to him he rests\n",
      "his faith on that definition of experience which underlies Aristotle's statement that \"the\n",
      "intellect is dependent upon intuition for knowledge both of what is below and what is above\n",
      "itself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it is this first set of factors which are the more important. For the cause, as distinguished\n",
      "from the occasions, of our present religious scale of values is, like all major causes, not\n",
      "practical but ideal, and its roots are found far beneath the soil of the present in the beginnings\n",
      "of the modern age in the fourteenth century. It was then that our world was born; it is of\n",
      "the essence of that world that it arose out of indifference toward speculative thinking and\n",
      "unfaith in those concepts regarding the origin and destiny of mankind which speculative philosophy\n",
      "tried to express and prove.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the first, then, humanistic leaders have not only frankly rejected the scholastic theologies,\n",
      "which had been the traditional expression of those absolute values with which the religious\n",
      "experience is chiefly concerned, but also ignored or rejected the existence of those values\n",
      "themselves. Thus Petrarch is generally considered the first of modern humanists. He not only\n",
      "speaks of Rome--meaning the whole semi-political, semi-ecclesiastical structure of dogmatic\n",
      "supernaturalism--as that \"profane Babylon\" but also reveals his rejection of the distinctively\n",
      "religious experience itself by characterizing as \"an impudent wench\" the Christian church.\n",
      "The attack is partly therefore on the faith in transcendent values which fixes man's relative\n",
      "position by projecting him upon the screen of an infinite existence and which asserts that\n",
      "he has an absolute, that is, an other-than-human guide. Again Erasmus, in his Praise of Folly,\n",
      "denounces indiscriminately churches, priesthoods, dogmas, ethical values, the whole structure\n",
      "of organized religion, calling it those \"foul smelling weeds of theology.\" It was inevitable\n",
      "that such men as Erasmus and Thomas More should hold aloof from the Reformation, not, as has\n",
      "been sometimes asserted, from any lack of moral courage but because of intellectual conviction.\n",
      "They saw little to choose between Lutheran, Calvinistic and Romish dogmatism. They had rejected\n",
      "not only mediaeval ecclesiasticism but also that view of the world founded on supersensuous\n",
      "values, whose persistent intimations had produced the speculative and scholastic theologies.\n",
      "To them, in a quite literal sense, the proper study of mankind was man.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hardly necessary to speak here of the attitude towards the old \"supernatural\" religion\n",
      "taken by the English Deists of the last half of the seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth\n",
      "century. Here was the first definite struggle of the English church with a group of thinkers\n",
      "who, under the leadership of Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke and others, attempted to adapt humanistic\n",
      "philosophy to theological speculation, to establish the sufficiency of natural religion as\n",
      "opposed to revelation, and to deny the unique significance of the Old and New Testament Scriptures.\n",
      "The English Deists were not deep or comprehensive thinkers, but they were typically humanistic\n",
      "in that their interests were not mainly theological or religious but rather those of a general\n",
      "culture. They were inconsistent with their humanism in their doctrine of a personal God who\n",
      "was not only remote but separated from his universe, a deus ex machina who excluded the idea\n",
      "of immanence. While less influential in England, they had a powerful effect upon French and\n",
      "German thinking. Both Voltaire and Rousseau were rationalists and Deists to the end of their\n",
      "days and both were unwearied foes of any other-than-natural sources for our spiritual knowledge\n",
      "and religious values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Germany the humanistic movement continued under Herder and his younger contemporaries, Schiller\n",
      "and Goethe. Its historical horizon, racial and literary sympathies, broadened under their direction,\n",
      "moving farther and farther beyond the sources and areas of accepted religious ideas and practices.\n",
      "They led the revival of study of the Aryan languages and cultures; especially those of the\n",
      "Hellenes and the inhabitants of the Indian peninsula. They originated that critical and rather\n",
      "hostile scrutiny of Semitic ideas and values in present civilization, which plays no small\n",
      "part in the dilettante naturalism of the moment. Thus the nature and place of man, under the\n",
      "influence of these \"uninspired\" literatures and cultures, became more and more important as\n",
      "both his person and his position in the cosmos ceased to be interpreted either in those terms\n",
      "of the moral transcendence of deity, or of the helplessness and insignificance of his creatures,\n",
      "which inform both the Jewish-Christian Scriptures and the philosophic absolutism of the Catholic\n",
      "theologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the humanism of the eighteenth century comes most closely to grips with the classic statements\n",
      "and concepts of religion in the critical philosophy of Kant. It is the intellectual current\n",

      "distinguish works of grace from works of nature, which is the essence of historic Christianity,\n",
      "or that we can detect the activity of heavenly influences is also superstition. All such supernaturalism\n",
      "lies beyond our ken. There are three common forms of superstition, all promoted by positive\n",
      "religion: the belief in miracles, the belief in mysteries, and the belief in the means of grace.\"[4]\n",

      "this is genuine rationalism. I am not forgetting Kant's great religious contribution. He was\n",
      "the son of devout German pietists and saturated in the literature of the Old Testament. It\n",
      "is to Amos, who may justly be called his spiritual father, that he owes the moral absoluteness\n",
      "of his categorical imperative, the reading of history as a moral order. He was following Amos\n",
      "when he took God out of the physical and put Him into the moral sphere and interpreted Him\n",

      "God is not known to us as an objective being, an entity without ourselves. He is an idea, a\n",

      "of the moral will. To quote Professor McGiffert again: \"We do not get God from the universe,\n",

      "Imperative is a subjective one, bounded by ourselves, formed of our substance. Religion is\n",

      "which are continually impinging upon him and his message. They form a perpetual attrition,\n",
      "working silently and ceaselessly day and night, wearing away the distinctively religious conceptions\n",

      "Now, this abstract humanism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had a considerable\n",
      "influence upon early American preaching. The latter part of the eighteenth century marked a\n",
      "breaking away from the Protestant scholasticism of the Reformation theology. The French Revolution\n",
      "accented and made operative, even across the Atlantic, the typical humanistic concepts of the\n",
      "rights of man and the sovereignty of the individual person. Skepticism and even atheism became\n",
      "a fashion in our infant republic. It was a mark of sophistication with many educated men to\n",
      "regard Christianity as not worthy of serious consideration. College students modestly admitted\n",
      "that they were infidels and with a delicious naÃ¯vetÃ© assumed the names of Voltaire, Thomas\n",
      "Paine and even of that notorious and notable egotist Rousseau. It is said that in 1795, on\n",
      "the first Sunday of President administration in Yale College, only three undergraduates remained\n",
      "after service to take the sacrament. The reasons were partly political, probably, but these\n",
      "themselves were grounded in the new philosophical, anti-religious attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this affected the churches. There was a reaction from Protestant scholasticism within\n",
      "them which, later on, culminated in Unitarianism, Universalism and Arminianism. The most significant\n",
      "thing in the Unitarian movement was not its rejection of the Trinitarian speculation, but its\n",
      "positive contribution to the reassertion of Jesus' doctrine of the worth and dignity of human\n",
      "nature. But it recovered that doctrine much more by the way of humanistic philosophy than by\n",
      "way of the teaching of the New Testament. I suppose the thing which has made the weakness of\n",
      "the Unitarian movement, its acknowledged lack of religious warmth and feeling, is due not to\n",
      "the place where it stands, but to the road by which it got there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, take it for all in all, the effect upon the preaching of the supernatural and speculative\n",
      "doctrines and insights of Christianity, was not in America as great as might be expected. Kant\n",
      "died in 1804, and Goethe in 1832, but only in the last sixty years has the preaching of the\n",
      "\"evangelical\" churches been fundamentally affected by the prevailing intellectual currents\n",
      "of the day. This is due, I think, to two causes. One was the nature of the German Reformation.\n",
      "It found preaching at a low ebb. Every great force, scholastic, popular, mystical, which had\n",
      "contributed to the splendor of the mediaeval pulpit had fallen into decay, and the widespread\n",
      "moral laxity of the clergy precluded spiritual insight. The Reformation, with its ethical and\n",
      "political interests, revived preaching and by the nature of these same interests fixed the\n",
      "limits and determined the direction within which it should develop. It is important to remember\n",
      "that Luther did not break with the old theological system. He continued his belief in an authority\n",
      "and revelation anterior, exterior and superior to man, merely shifting the locus of that authority\n",
      "from the Church to the Book. Thus he paved the way for Zwingli and the Protestant scholasticism\n",
      "which became more rigid and sterile than the Catholic which it succeeded. We usually regard\n",
      "the Reformation as a part of the Renaissance and hence included in the humanistic movement.\n",
      "Politically and religiously, it undoubtedly should be so regarded, for it was a chief factor\n",
      "in the renewal of German nationalism and its central doctrines of justification by faith, and\n",
      "the right of each separate believer to an unmediated access to the Highest, exalted the integrity\n",
      "and dignity of the individual. Inconsistently, however, it continued the old theological tradition.\n",
      "In the Lutheran system, says Paul de Lagarde, we see the Catholic scholastic structure standing\n",
      "untouched with the exception of a few loci. And Harnack, in the Dogmengeschichte calls it \"a\n",
      "miserable duplication of the Catholic Church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, New England preaching, it is true, found its chief roots in Calvinism; Calvin, rather\n",
      "than Luther, was the religious leader of the Reformation outside Germany. But his system, also,\n",
      "is only the continuation of the ancient philosophy of the Christian faith originating with\n",
      "Augustine. He reduced it to order, expounded it with energy and consistency, but one has only\n",
      "to recall its major doctrines of the depravity of man, the atonement for sin, the irresistible\n",
      "grace of the Holy Spirit, to see how untouched it was by the characteristic postulates of the\n",
      "new humanism. And it was on his theology that New England preaching was founded. It was Calvin\n",
      "who, through Jonathan Edwards, the elder and the younger, Joseph Bellamy, Samuel Hopkins, Nathaniel\n",
      "Emmons, Nathaniel N. Taylor, determined the course of the New England pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason for our relative immunity from humanistic influence is accidental and complementary\n",
      "merely. It is the mere fact of our physical isolation, which, until the last seventy-five years,\n",
      "quite largely shut off thinkers here from continental and English currents of thought and contributed\n",
      "to the brilliant, if sterile, provincialism of the New England theology.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, therefore, to the second set of media, which may be generally characterized as scientific\n",
      "and practical, that we now turn. These are the forces which apparently are most affecting Christian\n",
      "preaching at this moment. But it is important to remember that a large part of their influence\n",
      "is to be traced to the philosophic and ethical tendencies of the earlier humanistic movement\n",
      "which had set the scene for them, to which they are so sympathetic that we may assert that\n",
      "it is in them that their practical interests are grounded and by them that their scientific\n",
      "methods are reinforced. I divide this second group of media, for clearness, under three heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "First comes the rise of the natural sciences. In 1859, Darwin published the Origin of Species\n",
      "and gave to the world the evolutionary hypothesis, foreshadowed by Goethe and other eighteenth-century\n",
      "thinkers, simultaneously formulated by Wallace and himself. Here is a theory, open to objections\n",
      "certainly, not yet conclusively demonstrated, but the most probable one which we yet possess,\n",
      "as to the method of the appearance and the continuance of life upon the planet. It conceives\n",
      "of creation as an unimaginably long and intricate development from the inorganic to the organic,\n",
      "from simple to complex forms of life. Like Kantianism and the humanistic movement generally,\n",
      "the evolutionary hypothesis springs from reasoned observation of man and nature, not from any\n",
      "a priori or speculative process. With this theory, long a regulative idea of our world, preaching\n",
      "was forced to come to some sort of an understanding. It strikes a powerful blow at the scholastic\n",
      "notion of a dichotomized universe divided between nature and supernature, divine and human.\n",
      "It reinforced humanism by minimizing, if not making unnecessary, the objective and external\n",
      "source and external interpretations of religions. It pushes back the initial creative act until\n",
      "it is lost in the mists and chaos of an unimaginably remote past. Meanwhile, creative energy,\n",
      "the very essence of transcendent life, is, as we know it, not transcendent at all, but working\n",
      "outward from within, a part of the process, not above and beyond it. The inevitable implication\n",
      "here is that God is sufficiently, if not exclusively, known through natural and human media.\n",
      "Science recognizes Him in the terms of its own categories as in and of His world, a part of\n",
      "all its ongoings and developments. But His creative life is indistinguishable from, if not\n",
      "identical with, its expressions. Here, then, is a practical obliteration of the line once so\n",
      "sharply drawn between the natural and the supernatural. Hence the demarcation between the divine\n",
      "and human into mutually exclusive states has disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would seem, then, to wipe out also any knowledge of absolute values. Christian theism\n",
      "has interpreted God largely in static, final terms. The craving for the absolute in the human\n",
      "mind, as witnessed by the long course of the history of thought, as pathetically witnessed\n",
      "to in the mixture of chicanery, fanaticism and insight of the modern mystical and occult healing\n",
      "sects, is central and immeasurable. But God, found, if at all, in the terms of a present process,\n",
      "is not static and absolute, but dynamic and relative; indefinite, incomplete, not final. And\n",
      "man's immense difference from Him, that sense of the immeasurable space between creator and\n",
      "created, is strangely contracted. The gulf between holiness and guiltiness tends also to disappear.\n",
      "For our life would appear to be plastic and indefinite, a process rather than a state, not\n",
      "open then to conclusive moral estimates; incomplete, not fallen; life an orderly process, hence\n",
      "not perverse but defensible; without known breaks or infringements, hence relatively normal\n",
      "and sufficiently intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second factor was the rise of the humane sciences. In the seventh and eighth decades of the\n",
      "last century men were absorbed in the discovery of the nature and extent of the material universe.\n",
      "But beginning about 1890, interest swerved again toward man as its most revealing study and\n",
      "most significant inhabitant. Anthropology, ethnology, sociology, physical and functional psychology,\n",
      "came to the front. Especially the humane studies of political science and industrial economics\n",
      "were magnified because of the new and urgent problems born of an industrial civilization and\n",
      "a capitalistic state. The invention and perfection of the industrial machine had by now thoroughly\n",
      "dislocated former social groupings, made its own ethical standards and human problems. In the\n",
      "early days of the labor movement William Morris wrote, \"we have become slaves of the monster\n",
      "to which invention has given birth.\" In 1853, shortly after the introduction of the cotton\n",
      "gin into India, the Viceroy wrote: \"The misery is scarcely paralleled in the history of trade.\"\n",
      "(A large statement that!) \"The bones of the cotton workers whiten the plains of India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the temporary suffering caused by the immediate crowding out of cottage industry and the\n",
      "abrupt increase in production was insignificant beside the deeper influence, physical, moral,\n",
      "mental, of the machine in changing the permanent habitat and the entire mode of living for\n",
      "millions of human beings. It removed them from those healthy rural surroundings which preserve\n",
      "the half-primitive, half-poetic insight into the nature of things which comes from relative\n",
      "isolation and close contact with the soil, to the nervous tension, the amoral conditions, the\n",
      "airless, lightless ugliness of the early factory settlements. Here living conditions were not\n",
      "merely beastly; they were often bestial. The economic helplessness of the factory hands reduced\n",
      "them to essential slavery. They must live where the factory was, and could work only in one\n",
      "factory, for they could not afford to move. Hence they must obey their industrial master in\n",
      "every particular, since the raw material, the plant, the tools, the very roof that covered\n",
      "them, were all his! In this new human condition was a powerful reinforcement, from another\n",
      "angle of approach, of the humanistic impulse. Man's interest in himself, which had been sometimes\n",
      "that of the dilettante, largely imaginative and even sentimental, was reinforced by man's new\n",
      "distress and became concrete and scientific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus man regarded himself and his own world with a new and urgent attention. The methods and\n",
      "secondary causes of his intellectual, emotional and volitional life began to be laid bare.\n",
      "The new situation revealed the immense part played in shaping the personality and the fate\n",
      "of the individual by inheritance and environment. The Freudian doctrine, which traces conduct\n",
      "and habit back to early or prenatal repressions, strengthens the interest in the physical and\n",
      "materialistic sources of character and conduct in human life. Behavioristic psychology, interpreting\n",
      "human nature in terms of observation and action, rather than analysis and value judgments,\n",
      "does the same. It tends to put the same emphasis upon the external and sensationalistic aspects\n",
      "of human experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, then, which is a central force in religion, the sense of the inscrutability of human\n",
      "nature, the feeling of awe before the natural processes, what Paul called the mystery of iniquity\n",
      "and the mystery of godliness, tends to disappear. Wonder and confident curiosity succeed humility\n",
      "and awe. That which is of the essence of religion, the sense of helplessness coupled with the\n",
      "sense of responsibility, is stifled. Whatever else the humane sciences have done, they have\n",
      "deepened man's fascinated and narrowing absorption in himself and given him apparent reason\n",
      "to believe that by analyzing the iron chain of cause and effect which binds the process and\n",
      "admitting that it permits no deflection or variation, he is making the further questions as\n",
      "to the origin, meaning and destiny of that process either futile or superfluous. So that, in\n",
      "brief, the check to speculative thinking and the repudiation of central metaphysical concepts,\n",
      "which the earlier movement brought about, has been accentuated and sealed by the humane sciences\n",
      "and the new and living problems offered them for practical solution. Thus the generation now\n",
      "ending has been carried beyond the point of combating ancient doctrines of God and man, to\n",
      "the place where it has become comparatively indifferent, rather than hostile, to any doctrine\n",
      "of God, so absorbed is it in the physical functions, the temporal needs and the material manifestations\n",
      "of human personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as the natural and humane sciences mark new steps in the expanding humanistic movement,\n",
      "so in these last days, critical scholarship, itself largely a product of the humanistic viewpoint,\n",
      "has added another factor to the group. The new methods of historical and literary criticism,\n",
      "of comparative investigation in religion and the other arts, have exerted a vast influence\n",
      "upon contemporary religious thought. They have not merely completed the breakdown of an arbitrary\n",
      "and fixed external authority and rendered finally invalid the notion of equal or verbal inspiration\n",
      "in sacred writings, but the present tendency, especially in comparative religion, is to seek\n",
      "the source of all so-called religious experience within the human consciousness; particularly\n",
      "to derive it all from group experience. Here, then, is a theory of religious origins which\n",
      "once more turns the spirit of man back upon itself. Robertson Smith, Jane Harrison, Durkheim,\n",
      "rejecting an earlier animistic theory, find the origin of religion not in contemplation of\n",
      "the natural world and in the intuitive perception of something more-than-world which lies behind\n",
      "it, but in the group experience whose heightened emotional intensity and nervous energy imparts\n",
      "to the one the exaltation of the many. Smith, in the Religion of the Semites,[9] emphasizes,\n",
      "as the fundamental conception of ancient religion, \"the solidarity of the gods and their worshipers\n",
      "as part of an organic society.\" Durkheim goes beyond this. There are not at the beginning men\n",
      "and gods, but only the social group and the collective emotions and representations which are\n",
      "generated through membership in the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Footnote 9: P. 32.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, then, is humanism again carried to the very heart of the citadel. Religion at its source\n",
      "contains no real perceptions of any extra-human force or person. What seemed to be such perceptions\n",
      "were only the felt participation of the individual in a collective consciousness which is superindividual,\n",
      "but not superhuman and always continuous with the individual consciousness. So that, whatever\n",
      "may or may not be true later, the beginning of man's metaphysical interests, his cosmic consciousness,\n",
      "his more-than-human contacts, is simply his social experience, his collective emotions and\n",
      "representations. Thus Durkheim: \"We are able to say, in sum, that the religious individual\n",
      "does not deceive himself when he believes in the existence of a moral power upon which he depends\n",
      "and from which he holds the larger portion of himself. That power exists; it is society. When\n",
      "the Australian feels within himself the surging of a life whose intensity surprises him, he\n",
      "is the dupe of no illusion; that exaltation is real, and it is really the product of forces\n",
      "that are external and superior to the individual.\"[10] Yes, but identical in kind and genesis\n",
      "with himself and his own race. To Leuba, in his Psychological Study of Religion, this has already\n",
      "become the accepted viewpoint. Whatever is enduring and significant in religion is merely an\n",
      "expression of man's social consciousness and experience, his sense of participation in a common\n",
      "life. \"Humanity, idealized and conceived as a manifestation of creative energy, possesses surprising\n",
      "qualifications for a source of religious inspiration.\" Professor Overstreet, in \"The Democratic\n",
      "Conception of God,\" Hibbert Journal, volume XI, page 409, says: \"It is this large figure, not\n",
      "simply of human but of cosmic society which is to yield our God of the future. There is no\n",
      "place in the future for an eternally perfect being and no need--society, democratic from end\n",
      "to end, can brook no such radical class distinction as that between a supreme being, favored\n",

      "There is certainly a striking immediacy in such language. We leave for later treatment the\n",
      "question as to the historical validity of such an attitude. It certainly ignores some of the\n",
      "most distinguished and fruitful concepts of trained minds; it rules out of court what are to\n",
      "the majority of men real and precious factors in the religious experience. It would appear\n",
      "to be another instance, among the many, of the fallacy of identifying the part with the whole.\n",
      "But the effect of such pervasive thought currents, the more subtle and unfightable because\n",
      "indirect and disguised in popular appearance and influence, upon the ethical and spiritual\n",
      "temper of religious leaders, the very audacity of whose tasks puts them on the defensive, is\n",
      "vast and incalculable. At the worst, it drives man into a mechanicalized universe, with a resulting\n",
      "materialism of thought and life; at the best, it makes him a pragmatist with amiable but immediate\n",
      "objectives, just practical \"results\" as his guide and goal. Morality as, in Antigone's noble\n",
      "phrase, \"the unwritten law of heaven\" sinks down and disappears. There is no room here for\n",

      "no perceptible room, in such a world, for any of the absolute values, the transcendent interests,\n",
      "the ethics of idealism, any eschatology, or for Christian theodicy. That which has been the\n",
      "typical contribution of the religious perceptions in the past, namely, the comprehensive vision\n",
      "of life and the world and time sub specie aeternitatis is here abandoned. Eternity is unreal\n",
      "or empty; we never heard the music of the spheres. We are facing at this moment a disintegrating\n",
      "age. Here is a prime reason for it. The spiritual solidarity of mankind under the humanistic\n",
      "interpretation of life and destiny is dissolving and breaking down. Humanism is ingenious and\n",
      "reasonable and clever but it is too limited; it doesn't answer enough questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before going on, in a future chapter, to discuss the question as to what kind of preaching\n",
      "such a world-view, seen from the Christian standpoint, needs, we are now to inquire what the\n",
      "effect of this humanistic movement upon Christian preaching has already been. That our preaching\n",
      "should have been profoundly influenced by it is inevitable. Religion is not apart from the\n",
      "rest of life. The very temperament of the speaker makes him peculiarly susceptible to the intellectual\n",
      "and spiritual movements about him. What, then, has humanism done to preaching? Has it worked\n",
      "to clarify and solidify the essence of the religious position? Or has preaching declined and\n",
      "become neutralized in religious quality under it?\n",
      "\n",
      "First: it has profoundly affected Christian preaching about God. The contemporary sermon on\n",
      "Deity minimizes or leaves out divine transcendence; thus it starves one fundamental impulse\n",
      "in man--the need and desire to look up. Instead of this transcendence modern preaching emphasizes\n",
      "immanence, often to a naÃ¯ve and ludicrous degree. God is the being who is like us. Under the\n",
      "influence of that monistic idealism, which is a derived philosophy of the humanistic impulse,\n",
      "preaching lays all the emphasis upon divine immanence in sharpest contrast either to the deistic\n",
      "transcendence of the eighteenth century or the separateness and aloofness of the God of the\n",
      "Hebrew Scriptures, or of the classic Greek theologies of Christianity. God is, of course; that\n",
      "is, He is the informing principle in the natural and human universe and essentially one with\n",
      "it. Present preaching does not confess this identification but it evades rather than meets\n",
      "the logical pantheistic conclusion. So our preaching has to do with God in the common round\n",
      "of daily tasks; with sweeping a room to His glory; with adoration of His presence in a sunset\n",
      "and worship of Him in a star. Every bush's aflame with Him; there are sermons in stones and\n",
      "poems in running brooks. Before us, even as behind, God is and all is well. We are filled with\n",
      "a sort of intoxication with this intimate and protective company of the Infinite; we are magnificently\n",
      "unabashed as we familiarly approach Him. \"Closer is He than breathing; nearer than hands or\n",
      "feet.\" Not then by denying or condemning or distrusting the world in which we live, not by\n",
      "asserting the differences between God and humanity do we understand Him. But by closest touch\n",
      "with nature do we find Him. By a superb paradox, not without value, yet equally ineffable in\n",
      "sentimentality and sublime in its impiety we say, beholding man, \"that which is most human\n",
      "is most divine!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That there is truth in such comfortable and affable preaching is obvious; that there is not\n",
      "much truth in it is obvious, too. To what extent, and in what ways, nature, red with tooth\n",
      "and claw, indifferent, ruthless, whimsical, can be called the expression of the Christian God,\n",
      "is not usually specifically stated. In what way man, just emerging from the horror, the shame,\n",
      "the futility of his last and greatest debauch of bloody self-destruction, can be called the\n",
      "chief medium of truth, holiness and beauty, the matrix of divinity, is not entirely manifest.\n",
      "But the fatal defect of such preaching is not that there is not, of course, a real identity\n",
      "between the world and its Maker, the soul and its Creator, but that the aspect of reality which\n",
      "this truth expresses is the one which has least religious value, is least distinctive in the\n",
      "spiritual experience. The religious nature is satisfied, and the springs of moral action are\n",
      "refreshed by dwelling on the \"specialness\" of God; men are brought back to themselves, not\n",
      "among their fellows and by identifying them with their fellows, but by lifting them to the\n",
      "secret place of the Most High. They need religiously not thousand-tongued nature, but to be\n",
      "kept secretly in His pavilion from the strife of tongues. It is the difference between God\n",
      "and men which makes men who know themselves trust Him. It is the \"otherness,\" not the sameness,\n",
      "which makes Him desirable and potent in the daily round of life. A purely ethical interest\n",
      "in God ceases to be ethical and becomes complacent; when we rule out the supraphenomenal we\n",
      "have shut the door on the chief strength of the higher life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: modern preaching, under this same influence and to a yet greater degree, emphasizes\n",
      "the principle of identity, where we need that of difference, in its preaching about Jesus.\n",
      "He is still the most moving theme for the popular presentation of religion. But that is because\n",
      "He offers the most intelligible approach to that very \"otherness\" in the person of the godhead.\n",
      "His healing and reconciling influence over the heart of man--the way the human spirit expands\n",
      "and blossoms in His presence--is moving beyond expression to any observer, religious or irreligious.\n",
      "Each new crusade in the long strife for human betterment looks in sublime confidence to Him\n",
      "as its forerunner and defense. To what planes of common service, faith, magnanimous solicitude\n",
      "could He not lift the embittered, worldlyized men and women of this torn and distracted age,\n",
      "which is so desperately seeking its own life and thereby so inexorably losing it! But why is\n",
      "the heart subdued, the mind elevated, the will made tractable by Him? Why, because He is enough\n",
      "like us so that we know that He understands, has utter comprehension; and He is enough different\n",
      "from us so that we are willing to trust Him. In what lies the essence of the leadership of\n",
      "Jesus? He is not like us: therefore, we are willing to relinquish ourselves into His hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that is only half the truth. But if I may use a paradox, it is the important half, the\n",
      "primary half. And it is just that essential element in the Christian experience of Jesus that\n",
      "modern preaching, under the humanistic impulse, is neglecting. Indeed, liberal preachers have\n",
      "largely ceased to sermonize about Him, just because it has become so easy! Humanism has made\n",
      "Jesus obvious, hence, relatively impotent. With its unified cosmos, its immanent God, its exalted\n",
      "humanity, the whole Christological problem has become trivial. It drops the cosmic approach\n",
      "to the person of Jesus in favor of the ethical. It does not approach Him from the side of God;\n",
      "we approach nothing from that side now; but from the side of man. Thus He is not so much a\n",
      "divine revelation as He is a human achievement. Humanity and divinity are one in essence. The\n",
      "Creator is distinguished from His creatures in multifarious differences of degree but not in\n",
      "kind. We do not see, then, in Christ, a perfect isolated God, joined to a perfect isolated\n",
      "man, in what were indeed the incredible terms of the older and superseded Christologies. But\n",
      "rather, He is the perfect revelation of the moral being, the character of God, in all those\n",
      "ways capable of expression or comprehension in human life, just because he is the highest manifestation\n",
      "of a humanity through which God has been forever expressing Himself in the world. For man is,\n",
      "so to speak, his own cosmic center; the greatest divine manifestation which we know. Granted,\n",
      "then, an ideal man, a complete moral being, and ipso facto we have our supreme revelation of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "So runs the thrice familiar argument. Of course, we have gained something by it. We may drop\n",
      "gladly the old dualistic philosophy, and we must drop it, though I doubt if it is so easy to\n",
      "drop the dualistic experience which created it. But I beg to point out that, on the whole,\n",
      "we have lost more religiously than we have gained. For we have made Jesus easy to understand,\n",
      "not as He brings us up to His level, but as we have reduced Him to ours. Can we afford to do\n",
      "that? Bernard's mystical line, \"The love of Jesus, what it is, none but His loved ones know,\"\n",
      "has small meaning here. The argument is very good humanism but it drops the word \"Saviour\"\n",
      "out of the vocabulary of faith. Oh, how many sermons since, let us say, 1890, have been preached\n",
      "on the text, \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father.\" And how uniformly the sermons have\n",
      "explained that the text means not that Jesus is like God, but that God is like Jesus--and we\n",
      "have already seen that Jesus is like us! One only has to state it all to see beneath its superficial\n",
      "reasonableness its appalling profanity!\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: we may see the influence of humanism upon our preaching in the relinquishment of the\n",
      "goal of conversion. We are preaching to educate, not to save; to instruct, not to transform.\n",
      "Conversion may be gradual and half-unconscious, a long and normal process under favorable inheritance\n",
      "and with the culture of a Christian environment. Or it may be sudden and catastrophic, a violent\n",
      "change of emotional and volitional activity. When a man whose feeling has been repressed by\n",
      "sin and crusted over by deception, whose inner restlessness has been accumulating under the\n",
      "misery and impotence of a divided life, is brought into contact with Christian truth, he can\n",
      "only accept it through a volitional crisis, with its cleansing flood of penitence and confession\n",
      "and its blessed reward of the sense of pardon and peace and the relinquishment of the self\n",
      "into the divine hands. But one thing is true of either process in the Christian doctrine of\n",
      "conversion. It is not merely an achievement, although it is that; it is also a rescue. It cannot\n",
      "come about without faith, the \"will to believe\"; neither can it come about by that alone. Conversion\n",
      "is something we do; it is also something else, working within us, if we will let it, helping\n",
      "us to do; hence it is something done for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this experience of conversion is passing out of Christian life and preaching under humanistic\n",
      "influence. We are accepting the Socratic dictum that knowledge is virtue. Hence we blur the\n",
      "distinction between the Christian and the non-Christian. Education supplants salvation. We\n",
      "bring the boys and girls into the church because they are safer there than outside it; and\n",
      "on the whole it is a good thing to do and really they belong there anyway. The church member\n",
      "is a man of the world, softened by Christian feeling. He is a kindly and amiable citizen and\n",
      "an honorable man; he has not been saved. But he knows the unwisdom of evil; if you know what\n",
      "is right you will do it. Intelligence needs no support from grace. It is strange that the church\n",
      "does not see that with this relinquishment of her insistence upon something that religion can\n",
      "do for a man that nothing else can attempt, she has thereby given up her real excuse for being,\n",
      "and that her peculiar and distinctive mission has gone. It is strange that she does not see\n",
      "that the humanism which, since it is at home in the world, can sometimes make there a classic\n",
      "hero, degenerates dreadfully and becomes unreal in a church where unskilled hands use it to\n",
      "make it a substitute for a Christian saint! But for how many efficient parish administrators,\n",
      "Y.M.C.A. secretaries, up-to-date preachers, character is conceived of as coming not by discipline\n",
      "but by expansion, not by salvation, but by activity. Social service solves everything without\n",
      "any reference to the troublesome fact that the value of the service will depend upon the quality\n",
      "of the servant. Salvation is a combination of intelligence and machinery. Sin is pure ignorance\n",
      "or just maladjustment to environment. All we need is to know what is right and wrong; the humane\n",
      "sciences will take care of that; and, then, have an advertising agent, a gymnasium, a committee\n",
      "on spiritual resources, a program, a conference, a drive for money, and behold, the Kingdom\n",
      "of God is among us!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, and most significant: it is to the humanistic impulse and its derived philosophies\n",
      "that we owe the individualistic ethics, the relative absence of the sense of moral responsibility\n",
      "for the social order which has, from the beginning, maimed and distorted Protestant Christianity.\n",
      "It was, perhaps, a consequence of the speculative and absolute philosophies of the mediaeval\n",
      "church that, since they endeavored to relate religion to the whole of the cosmos, its remotest\n",
      "and ultimate issues, so they conceived of its absoluteness as concerned with the whole of human\n",
      "experience, with every relation of organized society. Under their regulative ideas all human\n",
      "beings, not a selected number, had, not in themselves but because of the Divine Sacrifice,\n",
      "divine significance; reverence was had, not for supermen or captains of industry, but for every\n",
      "one of those for whom Christ died. There were no human institutions which were ends in themselves\n",
      "or more important than the men which created and served them. The Holy Catholic Church was\n",
      "the only institution which was so conceived; all others, social, political, economic, were\n",
      "means toward the end of the preservation and expression of human personality. Hence, the interest\n",
      "of the mediaeval church in social ethics and corporate values; hence, the axiom of the church's\n",
      "control of, the believers' responsibility for, the economic relations of society. An unjust\n",
      "distribution of goods, the withholding from the producer of his fair share of the wealth which\n",
      "he creates, profiteering, predatory riches--these were ranked under one term as avarice, and\n",
      "they were counted not among the venial offenses, like aberrations of the flesh, but avarice\n",
      "was considered one of the seven deadly sins of the spirit. The application of the ethics of\n",
      "Jesus to social control began to die out as humanism individualized Christian morals and as,\n",
      "under its influence, nationalism tended to supplant the international ecclesiastical order.\n",
      "The cynical and sordid maxim that business is business; that, in the economic sphere, the standards\n",
      "of the church are not operative and the responsibility of the church is not recognized--notions\n",
      "which are a chief heresy and an outstanding disgrace of nineteenth-century religion, from which\n",
      "we are only now painfully and slowly reacting--these may be traced back to the influence of\n",
      "humanism upon Christian thought and conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, then, it seems to me abundantly clear that the humanistic movement has both limited\n",
      "and secularized Christian preaching. It dogmatically ignores supersensuous values; hence it\n",
      "has rationalized preaching hence it has made provincial its intellectual approach and treatment,\n",
      "narrowed and made mechanical its content. It has turned preaching away from speculative to\n",
      "practical themes. It was, perhaps, this mental and spiritual decline of the ministry to which\n",
      "a distinguished educator referred when he told a body of Congregational preachers that their\n",
      "sermons were marked by \"intellectual frugality.\" It is this which a great New England theologian-preacher,\n",
      "Dr. Gordon, means when he says \"an indescribable pettiness, a mean kind of retail trade has\n",
      "taken possession of the preachers; they have substituted the mill-round for the sun-path.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole world today tends toward a monstrous egotism. Man's attention is centered on himself,\n",
      "his temporal salvation, his external prosperity. Preaching, yielding partly to the intellectual\n",
      "and partly to the practical environment, has tended to adopt the same secular scale of values,\n",
      "somewhat pietized and intensified, and to move within the same area of operation. That is why\n",
      "most preaching today deals with relations of men with men, not of men with God. Yet human relationships\n",
      "can only be determined in the light of ultimate ones. Most preaching instinctively avoids the\n",
      "definitely religious themes; deals with the ethical aspects of devotion; with conduct rather\n",
      "than with worship; with the effects, not the causes, the expression, not the essence of the\n",
      "religious life. Most college preaching chiefly amounts to informal talks on conduct; somewhat\n",
      "idealized discussions of public questions; exhortations to social service. When sermons do\n",
      "deal with ultimate sanctions they can hardly be called Christian. They are often stoical; self-control\n",
      "is exalted as an heroic achievement, as being self-authenticating, carrying its own reward.\n",
      "Or they are utilitarian, giving a sentimentalized or frankly shrewd doctrine of expediencies,\n",
      "the appeal to an exaggerated self-respect, enlightened self-interest, social responsibility.\n",
      "These are typical humanistic values; they are real and potent and legitimate. But they are\n",
      "not religious and they do not touch religious motives. The very difference between the humanist\n",
      "and the Christian lies here. To obey a principle is moral and admirable; to do good and be\n",
      "good because it pays is sensible; but to act from love of a person is a joyous ecstasy, a liberation\n",
      "of power; it alone transforms life with an ultimate and enduring goodness. Genuine Christian\n",
      "preaching makes its final appeal, not to fear, not to hope, not to future rewards and punishments,\n",
      "not to reason or prudence or benevolence. It makes its appeal to love, and that means that\n",
      "it calls men to devotion to a living Being, a Transcendence beyond and without us. For you\n",
      "cannot love a principle, or relinquish yourself to an idea. You must love another living Being.\n",
      "Which amounts to saying that humanism just because it is self-contained is self-condemned.\n",
      "It minimizes or ignores the living God, in His world, but not to be identified with it; beyond\n",
      "it and above it; loving it because it needs to be loved; blessing it because saving it. In\n",
      "so doing, it lays the axe at the very root of the tree of religion. Francis Xavier, in his\n",
      "greatest of all hymns, has stated once for all the essence of the Christian motive and the\n",
      "religious attitude:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"O Deus, ego amo te\n",
      "  Nec amo te ut salves me\n",
      "  Aut quia non amantes te\n",
      "  Aeternis punis igne.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Nee praemii illius spe\n",
      "  Sed sicut tu amasti me\n",
      "  Sic amo et amabo te\n",
      "  Solem, quia Rex meus est.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, has been the final effect of humanism upon preaching? It has tempted the preacher\n",
      "to depersonalize religion. And since love is the essence of personality, it has thereby stripped\n",
      "preaching of the emotional energy, of the universal human interests and the prophetic insight\n",
      "which only love can bestow. Over against this depersonalization, we must find some way to return\n",
      "to expressing the religious view and utilizing the religious power of the human spirit.\n",

      "\n",
      "We ventured to say in the preceding chapter that, under the influences of more than three centuries\n",
      "of humanism, the spiritual solidarity of mankind is breaking down. For humanism makes an inhuman\n",
      "demand upon the will; it minimizes the force of the subrational and it largely ignores the\n",
      "superrational elements in human experience; it does not answer enough questions. Indeed, it\n",
      "is frankly confessed, particularly by students of the political and economic forces now working\n",
      "in society, that the new freedom born in the Renaissance is, in some grave sense, a failure.\n",
      "It destroyed what had been the common moral authority of European civilization in its denial\n",
      "of the rule of the church. But for nearly four centuries it has become increasingly clear that\n",
      "it offered no adequate substitute for the supernatural moral and religious order which it supplanted.\n",
      "John Morley was certainly one of the most enlightened and humane positivists of the last generation.\n",
      "In his Recollections, published three years ago, there is a final paragraph which runs as follows:\n",
      "\"A painful interrogatory, I must confess, emerges. Has not your school held the civilized world,\n",
      "both old and new alike, in the hollow of their hand for two long generations past? Is it quite\n",
      "clear that their influence has been so much more potent than the gospel of the various churches?\n",
      "Circumspice. Is not diplomacy, unkindly called by Voltaire the field of lies, as able as ever\n",
      "it was to dupe governments and governed by grand abstract catchwords veiling obscure and inexplicable\n",
      "purposes, and turning the whole world over with blood and tears, to a strange Witch's Sabbath?\"[11]\n",
      "This is his conclusion of the whole matter.\n",

      "[Footnote 11: Recollections: II, p. 366 ff.]\n",
      "\n",
      "But while the reasons for the failure are not far to seek, it is worth while for the preacher\n",
      "to dwell on them for a moment. In strongly centered souls like a Morley or an Erasmus, humanism\n",
      "produces a stoical endurance and a sublime self-confidence. But it tends, in lesser spirits,\n",
      "to a restless arrogance. Hence, both those lower elements in human nature, the nature and extent\n",
      "of whose force it either cloaks or minimizes, and those imponderable and supersensuous values\n",
      "which it tends to ignore and which are not ordinarily included in its definition of experience,\n",
      "return to vex and plague it. Indeed the worst foe of humanism has never been the religious\n",
      "view of the world upon whose stored-up moral reserves of uncompromising doctrine it has often\n",
      "half-consciously subsisted. Humanism has long profited from the admitted truth that the moral\n",
      "restraints of an age that possesses an authoritative and absolute belief survive for some time\n",
      "after the doctrine itself has been rejected. What has revealed the incompleteness of the humanistic\n",
      "position has been its constant tendency to decline into naturalism; a tendency markedly accelerated\n",
      "today. Hence, we find ourselves in a disintegrating and distracted epoch. In 1912 Rudolph Eucken\n",

      "of the planet, and by the further critical observation of nature he proposes to interpret and\n",
      "guide his life. He is convinced that this combined authority of reason and observation will\n",
      "lead to the summum bonum of the golden mean in which unbridled self-expression will be seen\n",
      "as equally unwise and indecent and ascetic repression as both unworthy and unnecessary. It\n",

      "its own fate, and in reason and natural observation as offering it the means of this self-control\n",

      "Just as religion so often sinks into bigotry, cruelty and superstitition, so humanism, in lesser\n",
      "souls, declines to egotism, license and sentimentality. Naturalism, either by a shallow and\n",

      "fixed points of a humane order--and to return in principle, and so far as he dares in action,\n",
      "to the unlimited and irresponsible individualism of the horde. Inevitably the law of the jungle\n",

      "own spirit data for the guidance of the race, improving upon it by a cultivated and collective\n",
      "experience. The naturalist uncritically exalts nature, seeks identification with it so that\n",
      "he may freely exploit both himself and it. The faith of the one is in the self-sufficiency\n",
      "of the disciplined spirit of mankind; the unfaith of the other is in its glorification of the\n",

      "Now, the clearest way to get before us the religious view of the world and the law which issues\n",

      "takes a very different view of nature than either romantic, or to a less degree scientific,\n",
      "naturalism. Naturalism is subrational on the one hand or non-imaginative on the other, in that\n",
      "it emphasizes the continuity between man and the physical universe. The religious man is superrational\n",
      "and nobly imaginative as he emphasizes the difference between man and nature. He does not forget\n",
      "man's biological kinship to the brute, his intimate structural and even psychological relation\n",
      "to the primates, but he is aware that it is not in dwelling upon these facts that his spirit\n",
      "discovers what is distinctive to man as man. That he believes will be found by accenting the\n",
      "chasm between man and nature. He does not know how to conceive of a personal being except by\n",
      "thinking of him as proceeding by other, though not conflicting, laws and by moving toward different\n",
      "secondary ends from those laws and ends which govern the impersonal external world. This sense\n",
      "of the difference between man and nature he shares with the humanist, only the humanist does\n",
      "not carry it as far as he does and hence may not draw from it his ultimate conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The religious view, then, begins with the perception of man's isolation in the natural order;\n",
      "his difference from his surroundings. That sense of separateness is fundamental to the religious\n",
      "nature. The false sentiment and partial science of the pagan which stresses the identification\n",
      "of man and beast is the first quarrel that religionist and humanist alike have with him. Neither\n",
      "of them sanctions this perversion of thought and feeling which either projects the impressionistic\n",
      "self so absurdly and perilously into the natural order, or else minimizes man's imaginative\n",
      "and intellectual power, leveling him down to the amoral instinct of the brute. \"How much more,\"\n",

      "them. But what makes the gulf deeper is the sense of the immeasurable moral difference between\n",

      "our cruelty, our self-love, our lust, not greatly caring if we break His laws, tossing out\n",
      "His indiscriminate gifts, and vaguely trusting in our automatic arrival at virtue. Even as\n",
      "in philosophy, it is psychologists, experts in empirical science and methods, and sociologists,\n",
      "experts in practical ethics, who may be found, while the historian and the metaphysician are\n",
      "increasingly rare, so in preaching we are amiable and pious and ethical and practical and informative,\n",
      "but the vision and the absolutism of religion are a departing glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "What complicates the danger and difficulty of such a position, with its confusion of natural\n",
      "and human values, and its rationalizing and secularizing of theistic thinking, is that it has\n",
      "its measure of reality. All these observations of naturalist and humanist are half truths,\n",
      "and for that very reason more perilous than utter falsehoods. For the mind tends to rest contented\n",
      "within their areas, and so the partial becomes the worst enemy of the whole. What we have been\n",
      "doing is stressing the indubitable identity between man and nature and between the Creator\n",
      "and His creatures to the point of unreality, forgetting the equally important fact of the difference,\n",
      "the distinction between the two. But sound knowledge and normal feeling rest upon observing\n",
      "and reckoning with both aspects of this law of kinship and contrast. All human experience becomes\n",
      "known to us through the interplay of what appear to be contradictory needs and opposing truths\n",
      "within our being. Thus, man is a social animal and can only find himself in a series of relationships\n",
      "as producer, lover, husband, father and friend. He is a part of and like unto his kind, his\n",
      "spirit immanent in his race. But man is also a solitary creature, and in that very solitariness,\n",
      "which he knows as he contrasts it with his social interests, he finds identity of self, the\n",
      "something which makes us \"us,\" which separates us from all others in the world. A Crusoe, marooned\n",
      "on a South Sea island, without even a black man Friday for companionship, would soon cease\n",
      "to be a man; personality would forsake him. But the same Crusoe is equally in need of solitude.\n",
      "The hell of the barracks, no matter how well conducted, is their hideous lack of privacy; men\n",
      "condemned by shipwreck or imprisonment to an unbroken and intimate companionship kill their\n",
      "comrade or themselves. We are all alike and hence gregarious; we are all different and hence\n",
      "flee as a bird to the mountain. The reality of human personality lies in neither one aspect\n",
      "of the truth nor the other, but in both. The truth is found as we hold the balance between\n",
      "identity and difference. Hence we are not able to think of personality in the Godhead unless\n",
      "we conceive of God as being, within Himself, a social no less than a solitary Being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this law that the truth is found in the balance of the antinomies appears in man's equal\n",
      "passion for continuity and permanency and for variety and change. The book of Revelation tells\n",
      "us that the redeemed, before the great white throne, standing upon the sea of glass, sing the\n",
      "song of Moses and the Lamb. What has the one to do with the other? Here is the savage, triumphant\n",
      "chant of the far dawn of Israel's history, joined with the furthest and latest possible events\n",
      "and words. Well, it at least suggests the continuity of the ageless struggle of mankind, showing\n",
      "that the past has its place in the present, relieving man's horror of the impermanence, the\n",
      "disjointed character of existence. He wants something orderly and static. But, like the jet\n",
      "of water in the fountain, his life is forever collapsing and collapsing, falling in upon itself,\n",
      "its apparent permanence nothing but a rapid and glittering succession of impermanences. The\n",
      "dread of growing old is chiefly that, as years come on, life changes more and faster, becomes\n",
      "a continual process of readjustment. Therefore we want something fixed; like the sailor with\n",
      "his compass, we must have some needle, even if a tremulous one, always pointing toward a changeless\n",
      "star. Yet this is but one half of the picture. Does man desire continuity?--quite as much does\n",
      "he wish for variety, cessation of old ways, change and fresh beginnings. The most terrible\n",
      "figure which the subtle imagination of the Middle Ages conjured up was that of the Wandering\n",
      "Jew, the man who could not die! Here, then, we arrive at knowledge, the genuine values of experience,\n",
      "by this same balancing of opposites. Continuity alone kills; perpetual change strips life of\n",
      "significance; man must have both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is in the religious field that this interests us most. We have seen that what we have\n",
      "been doing there of late has been to ignore the fact that reality is found only through this\n",
      "balancing of the law of difference and identity, contrast and likeness. We have been absorbed\n",
      "in one half of reality, identifying man with nature, prating of his self-sufficiency, seeing\n",
      "divinity almost exclusively as immanent in the phenomenal world. Thus we have not merely been\n",
      "dealing with only one half of the truth, but that, to use a solecism, the lesser half.\n",
      "\n",
      "For doubtless men do desire in religion a recognition of the real values of their physical\n",
      "nature. And they want rules of conduct, a guide for practical affairs, a scale of values for\n",
      "this world. This satisfies the craving for temporal adjustment, the sense of the goodness and\n",
      "worth of what our instinct transmits to us. But it does nothing to meet that profound dissatisfaction\n",
      "with this world and that sense of the encumbrances of the flesh which is also a part of reality\n",
      "and, to the religious man, perhaps the greater part. He wants to turn away from all these present\n",
      "things and be kept secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Here he has no continuing\n",
      "city. Always while we dwell here we have a dim and restless sense that we are in an unreal\n",
      "country and we know, in our still moments, that we shall only come to ourselves when we return\n",
      "to the house of our Father. Hence men have never been satisfied with religious leaders who\n",
      "chiefly interpreted this world to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed, since July, 1914, and down to and including this very hour, this idealizing of\n",
      "time, which we had almost accepted as our office, has had a ghastly exposure. Because there\n",
      "has come upon us all one of these irrevocable and irremediable disasters, for which time has\n",
      "no word of hope, to which Nature is totally indifferent, for which the God of the outgoings\n",
      "and incomings of the morning is too small. For millions of living and suffering men and women\n",
      "all temporal and mortal values have been wiped out. They have been caught in a catastrophe\n",
      "so ruthless and dreadful that it has strewed their bodies in heaps over the fields and valleys\n",
      "of many nations. Today central and south and northeastern Europe and western Asia are filled\n",
      "with idle and hungry and desperate men and women. They have been deprived of peace, of security,\n",
      "of bread, of enlightenment alike. Something more than temporal salvation and human words of\n",
      "hope are needed here. Something more than ethical reform and social readjustment and economic\n",
      "alleviation, admirable though these are! Something there must be in human nature that eclipses\n",

      "Nature, but on his far-flung difference; not on his self-sufficiency, but on his tragic helplessness;\n",
      "not on the God of the market place, the office and the street, an immanent and relative deity,\n",

      "things, is its characteristic and most precious contribution to the world. We are seeing how\n",
      "every human problem when pressed to its ultimate issue becomes theological. Here is where the\n",
      "fertile field for contemporary preaching lies. It is found, not in remaining with those elements\n",
      "in the religious consciousness which it shares in common with naturalism and humanism, but\n",
      "in passing over to those which are distinctive to itself alone. It has always been true, but\n",
      "it is especially true at this moment, that effective preaching has to do chiefly with transcendent\n",
      "values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our task is to assert, first, then, the \"otherness\" of man, his difference from Nature, to\n",
      "point out the illusoriness of her phenomena for him, the derived reality and secondary value\n",
      "of her facts. These are things that need religious elucidation. The phrase \"other-worldliness\"\n",
      "has come, not without reason, to have an evil connotation among us, but there is nevertheless\n",
      "a genuine disdain of this world, a sense of high superiority to it and profound indifference\n",
      "toward it, which is of the essence of the religious attitude. He who knows that here he is\n",
      "a stranger, sojourning in tabernacles; that he belongs by his nature, not to this world, but\n",
      "that he seeks a better, that is to say, a heavenly country, will for the joy that is set before\n",
      "him, endure a cross and will despise the shame. He will have a conscious superiority to hostile\n",
      "facts of whatever sort or magnitude, for he knows that they deceive in so far as they pretend\n",
      "to finality. When religion has thus acquired a clear-sighted and thoroughgoing indifference\n",
      "to the natural order, then, and then only, it begins to be potent within that order. Then,\n",
      "as Professor Hocking says, it rises superior to the world of facts and becomes irresistible.[31]\n",

      "[Footnote 31: The Meaning of God in Human Experience, p. 518.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The time is ripe, then, first, for the preacher to emphasize the inward and essential difference\n",
      "between man and nature which exists under the outward likeness, to remind him of this more-than-nature,\n",
      "this \"otherness\" of man, without which he would lose his most precious possession, the sense\n",
      "of personality. Faith begins by recognizing this transcendent element in man and the acceptance\n",
      "of it is the foundation of religious preaching. What was the worst thing about the war? Not\n",
      "its destruction nor its horrors nor its futilities, but its shames; the dreadful indignities\n",
      "which it inflicted upon man; it treated men as though they were not souls! No such moral catastrophe\n",
      "could have overwhelmed us if we had not for long let the brute lie too near the values and\n",
      "practices of our lives, depersonalizing thus, in politics and industry and morals and religion,\n",
      "our civilization. It all proceeded from the irreligious interpretation of human existence,\n",
      "and the fruits of that interpretation are before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first task of the preacher, then, is to combat the naturalistic interpretation of humanity\n",
      "with every insight and every conviction that is within his power. If we are to restore religious\n",
      "values, rebuild a world of transcendent ends and more-than-natural beauty, we must begin here\n",
      "with man. In the popular understanding of the phrase all life is not essentially one in kind;\n",
      "physical self-preservation and reproduction are not the be-all and the end-all of existence.\n",
      "There is something more to be expressed in man without which these are but dust and ashes in\n",
      "the mouth. There is another kind of life mixed in with this, the obvious. If we cannot express\n",
      "the other world, we shall not long tolerate this one. To think that this world is all, leans\n",
      "toward madness; such a picture of man is a travesty, not a portrait of his nature. Only on\n",
      "some such basic truths as these can we build character in our young people. Paganism tells\n",
      "them that it is neither natural nor possible to keep themselves unspotted from the world. Over\n",
      "against it we must reiterate, You can and you must! for the man that sinneth wrongeth his own\n",
      "soul. You are something more than physical hunger and reproductive instinct; you are of spirit\n",
      "no less than dust. How, then, can you do this great sin against God!\n",
      "\n",
      "How abundant here are the data with which religious preaching may deal. Indeed, as Huxley and\n",
      "scores of others have pointed out, it is only the religious view of man that builds up civilization.\n",
      "A great community is the record of man's supernaturalism, his uniqueness. It is built on the\n",
      "\"higher-than-self\" principle which is involved in the moral sense itself. And this higher-than-self\n",
      "is not just a collective naturalism, a social consciousness, as Durkheim and Overstreet and\n",
      "Miss Harrison would say. The simplest introspective act will prove that. For a man cannot ignore\n",
      "self-condemnation as if it were only a natural difficulty, nor disparage it as though it were\n",
      "merely humanly imposed. We think it comes from that which is above and without, because it\n",
      "speaks to the solitary and the unique, not the social and the common part of us. Hence conscience\n",
      "is not chiefly a tribal product, for it is what separates us from the group and in our isolation\n",
      "unites us with something other than the group. \"Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned and\n",
      "done this evil in Thy sight.\" So religious preaching perpetually holds us up above our natural\n",
      "selves and the natural order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus man must live by an other-than-natural law if he is to preserve the family, which is the\n",
      "social unit of civilization. Its very existence depends upon modifying and transforming natural\n",
      "hunger by a diviner instinct, by making voluntary repressions, willing sacrifices of the lower\n",
      "to the higher, the subordinating of the law of self and might to the law of sacrifice and love--this\n",
      "is what preserves family life. Animals indeed rear and cherish their young and for the mating\n",
      "season remain true to one another, but no animality per se ever yet built a home. There must\n",
      "be a more-than-natural law in the state. Our national life and honor rest upon the stability\n",
      "of the democracy and we can only maintain that by walking a very straight and narrow path.\n",
      "For the peace of freedom as distinguished from precarious license is a more-than-natural attainment,\n",
      "born of self-repression and social discipline, the voluntary relinquishment of lesser rights\n",
      "for higher rights, of personal privileges for the sake of the common good. Government by the\n",
      "broad and easy path, following the lines of least resistance, like the natural order, saying\n",
      "might is right, means either tyranny or anarchy. Circumspice! One of the glories of western\n",
      "civilization is its hospitals. They stand for the supernatural doctrine of the survival of\n",
      "the unfit, the conviction of the community that, to take the easy path of casting out the aged\n",
      "and infirm, the sick and the suffering, would mean incalculable degeneration of national character,\n",
      "and that the difficult and costly path of protection and ministering service is both necessary\n",
      "and right. And why is the reformatory replacing the prison? Because we have learned that the\n",
      "obvious, natural way of dealing with the criminal certainly destroys him and threatens to destroy\n",
      "us; and that the hard, difficult path of reeducating and reforming a vicious life is the one\n",
      "which the state for her own safety must follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genuine preaching, then, first of all, calls men to repentance, bids them turn away from their\n",
      "natural selves, and, to find that other and realer self, enter the straight and narrow gate.\n",
      "The call is not an arbitrary command, born of a negative and repressive spirit. It is a profound\n",
      "exhortation based upon a fundamental law of human progress, having behind it the inviolable\n",
      "sanction of the truth. Such preaching would have the authentic note. It is self-verifying.\n",
      "It stirs to answer that quality--both moral and imaginative--in the spirit of man which craves\n",
      "the pain and difficulty and satisfaction of separation from the natural order. It appeals to\n",
      "a timeless worth in man which transcends any values of mere intelligence which vary with the\n",
      "ages, or any material prosperity which perishes with the using, or any volitional activity\n",
      "that dies in its own expenditure. Much of the philosophy of Socrates was long ago outmoded,\n",
      "but Socrates himself, as depicted in the Phaedo, confronting death with the cup of hemlock\n",
      "in his hand, saying with a smile, \"There is no evil which can happen to a good man living or\n",
      "dead,\" has a more-than-natural, an enduring and transcendent quality. Whenever we preach to\n",
      "the element in mankind which produces such attitudes toward life and bid it assert itself,\n",
      "then we are doing religious preaching, and then we speak with power. Jesus lived within the\n",
      "inexorable circle of the ideas of His time; He staked much on the coming of the new kingdom\n",
      "which did not appear either when or as He had first expected it. He had to adjust, as do we\n",
      "all, His life to His experience, His destiny to His fate. But when He was hanging on His cross,\n",
      "forgotten of men and apparently deserted by His God, something in Him that had nothing to do\n",
      "with nature or the brute rose to a final expression and by its more-than-natural reality, sealed\n",
      "and authenticated His life. Looking down upon His torturers, understanding them far better\n",
      "than they understood themselves, He cried, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they\n",
      "do.\" That cry has no place in nature; it has no application and no meaning outside the human\n",
      "heart and that which is above, not beneath, the human heart, from which it is derived. There,\n",
      "then, again was the supernatural law; there was the more-than-nature in man which makes nature\n",
      "into human nature; and there is the thing to whose discovery, cultivation, expression, real\n",
      "preaching is addressed. 30-35.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Such preaching is a perpetual refutation of and rebuke to the naturalism and imperialism of\n",
      "our present society. It is the call to the absolute in man, to a clear issue with evil. It\n",
      "would not cry peace, peace, when there is no peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this insistence upon the difference from nature, the more-than-natural in man, the\n",
      "second thing in religious preaching will have to be, obviously, the message of salvation. That\n",
      "is to say, reducing the statement to its lowest terms, if man is to live by such a law, the\n",
      "law of more-than-nature, then he must have something also more-than-human to help him in his\n",
      "task. He will need strength from outside. Indeed, because religion declares that there is such\n",
      "divine assistance, and that faith can command it, is the chief cause and reason for our existence.\n",
      "When we cease to preach salvation in some form or other, we deny our own selves; we efface\n",
      "our own existence. For no one can preach the more-than-human in mankind without emphasizing\n",
      "those elements of free will, moral responsibility, the need and capacity for struggle and holiness\n",
      "in human life which it indicates, and which in every age have been a part of the message of\n",
      "Him who said, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father, which is in heaven, is perfect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, as we have previously corrected the half truth of the naturalist who makes a caricature,\n",
      "not a portrait of man, we must now in the same way turn to the correcting of the humanist's\n",
      "emphasis upon man's native capacity and insist upon the complementary truth which fulfills\n",
      "this moral heroism of mankind, namely, the divine rescue which answers to its inadequacy. Man\n",
      "must struggle for his victory; he can win; he cannot win alone. We must then insist upon the\n",
      "doctrine of salvation, turning ourselves to the other side of the humanist's picture. Man cannot\n",
      "live by this more-than-natural law unaided. For not only has he the power to rise above Nature;\n",
      "the same thing gives him equal capacity to sink beneath her, and, when left to himself, he\n",
      "generally does so. The preacher does not dare deny the sovereignty of sin. Humanism hates the\n",
      "very name of sin; it has never made any serious attempt to explain the consciousness of guilt.\n",
      "Neither naturalist nor humanist can afford to admit sin, for sin takes man, as holiness does,\n",
      "outside the iron chain of cause and effect; it breaks the law; it is not strictly natural.\n",
      "It makes clear enough that man is outside the natural order in two ways. He is both inferior\n",
      "and superior to it. He falls beneath, he rises above it. When he acts like a beast, he is not\n",
      "clean and beastly, but unclean and bestial. When he lifts his head in moral anguish, bathes\n",
      "all his spirit in the flood of awe and repentance, is transfigured with the glorious madness\n",
      "of self-sacrifice, he is so many worlds higher than the beast that their relationship becomes\n",
      "irrelevant. So we must deal more completely than humanists do with the central mystery of our\n",
      "experience; man's impotent idealism, his insight not matched with consummation; the fact that\n",
      "what he dares to dream of he is not able alone to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the humanist exalts man, which is good; but then he makes him self-sufficient for the struggle\n",
      "which such exaltation demands, which is bad. In that partial understanding he departs from\n",
      "truth. And what is it that makes the futility of so much present preaching? It is the acceptance\n",
      "of this doctrine of man's moral adequacy and consequently the almost total lack either of the\n",
      "assurance of grace or of the appeal to the will. No wonder such exhortations cannot stem the\n",
      "tide of an ever increasing worldliness. Such preaching stimulates the mind; in both the better\n",
      "and the worse preachers, it moves the emotions but it gives men little power to act on what\n",
      "they hear and feel to the transformation of their daily existence. Thus the humanistic sense\n",
      "of man's sufficiency, coupled with the inherent distrust of any notion of help from beyond\n",
      "and above, any belief in a reinforcing power which a critical rationalism cannot dissect and\n",
      "explain, has gradually ruled out of court the doctrine of salvation until the preacher's power,\n",
      "both to experience and to transmit it, has atrophied through disuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who can doubt that one large reason why crude and indefensible concepts of the Christian faith\n",
      "have such a disconcerting vitality today is because they carry, in their outmoded, unethical,\n",
      "discredited forms, the truth of man's insufficiency in himself and the confident assurance\n",
      "of that something coming from without which will abundantly complete the struggling life within?\n",
      "They offer the assurance of that peace and moral victory which man so ardently desires, because\n",
      "they declare that it is both a discovery and a revelation, an achievement and a rescue. There\n",
      "are vigorous and rapidly growing popular movements of the day which rest their summation of\n",
      "faith on the quadrilateral of an inerrant and verbally inspired Scripture, the full deity of\n",
      "Jesus Christ, the efficacy of His substitutionary atonement, the speedy second coming of the\n",
      "Lord. No sane person can suppose that these cults succeed because of the ethical insight, the\n",
      "spiritual sensitiveness, the intellectual integrity of such a message. It does not possess\n",
      "these things. They succeed, in spite of their obscurantism, because they do confess and meet\n",
      "man's central need, his need to be saved. The power of that fact is what is able to carry so\n",
      "narrow and so indefensible a doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the second problem of the preacher is clear. Man asserts his potential independence of the\n",

      "only a stage, a present achievement in cosmic progress or human understanding. But that does\n",
      "not alter the incontestable witness of present experience that the religious consciousness\n",
      "is based upon, interwoven with, the sense of the cosmic division without, and the unresolved\n",
      "moral dualism within the individual life. It is important enough to remember, however, that\n",
      "we have rejected, at least for this generation, the old scholastic theologies founded on this\n",
      "general experience. Fashions of thought change with significant facility; there is not much\n",
      "of the Absolute about them! Nevertheless we cannot think with forgotten terms. Therefore ours\n",
      "is no mechanically divided world where man and God, nature and supernature, soul and body,\n",
      "belong to mutually exclusive territories. We do not deny the principle of identity. Hence we\n",
      "have discarded that old view of the world and all the elder doctrines of an absentee creator,\n",
      "a worthless and totally depraved humanity, a legalistic or substitutionary atonement, a magical\n",

      "perpetual vision of another nature, behind and beneath phenomena, from which the old dualism\n",
      "took its rise. It is the form which it assumed, the interpretation of experience which it gave,\n",
      "not the facts themselves, obscure but stubborn as they are, which it confessed, that we have\n",
      "dropped. Identity and difference are still here; man is a part of his world, but he is also\n",

      "as one, and yet be able to show that the He or the It, beyond and without the world, is its\n",
      "only conceivable beginning, its only conceivable end, the chief hope of its brevity, the only\n",
      "stay of its idealism. It was the arbitrary and mechanical completeness of the old division,\n",
      "not the reality that underlay the distinction itself, which parted company with truth and hence\n",
      "lost the allegiance of the mind. It was that the old dualism tried to lock up this, the most\n",
      "baffling of all realities, in a formula,--that was what undid it. But we shall be equally foolish\n",
      "if now, in the interests of a new artificial clearness, we deny another portion of experience\n",
      "just as our fathers ignored certain other facts in the interests of their too well-defined\n",
      "systems. We cannot hold to the old world view which would bend the modern mind to the support\n",
      "of an inherited interpretation of experience and therefore would not any longer really explain\n",
      "or confirm it. Neither can we hold new views which mutilate the experience and leave out some\n",
      "of the most precious elements in it, even if in so doing we should simplify the problem for\n",
      "the mind. It would be an unreal simplification; it would darken, not illumine, the understanding;\n",
      "we should never rest in it. Nor do we need to be concerned if the intellect cannot perfectly\n",
      "order or easily demonstrate the whole of the religious life, fit each element with a self-verifying\n",
      "defense and explanation. No man of the world, to say nothing of a man of faith or imagination,\n",
      "has ever yet trusted to a purely intellectual judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we reject the old dualism, its dichotomized universe, its two sorts of authority, its prodigious\n",
      "and arbitrary supernaturalism. But we do not reject what lay behind it. Still we wrestle with\n",
      "the angel, lamed though we are by the contest, and we cannot let him go until the day breaks\n",
      "and the shadows flee away. It would be easier perhaps to give up the religious point of view,\n",
      "but for that ease we should pay with our life. For that swift answer, achieved by leaving out\n",
      "prime factors in the problem, we should be betraying the self for whose sake alone any answer\n",
      "is valuable. It does not pay to cut such Gordian knots! Our task, then, is to preach transcendence\n",
      "again, not in terms of the old absolutist philosophy, but in terms of the perceptions, the\n",
      "needs, the experience of the human heart and mind and will which produced that philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is this so hard to do. Now, as always for the genuinely religious temperament, there are\n",
      "abundant riches of material lying ready to its hand. It is not difficult to make transcendence\n",
      "real and to reveal to men their consummate need of it when we speak of it in the language of\n",
      "experience and perception. What preaching should avoid is the abstractions of an archaic system\n",
      "of thought with all their provocative and contentious elements, the mingled dogmatism and incompleteness\n",
      "which any worked-out system contains. It is so foolish in the preacher to turn himself into\n",

      "it is repressed by an irreligious asceticism or narrowed and stunted by a literal and external\n",

      "the world full of a high pleasure crowded with sound, color, fragrance, form, in which he takes\n",
      "exquisite delight. There is, in short, a serene and poetic naturalism, loosely called \"nature-worship,\"\n",
      "which is keenly felt by both saints and sinners. All it needs for its consecration and perfection\n",
      "is to help men to see that this naturalism is vital and precious because, as a matter of fact,\n",
      "it is something more than naturalism, and more than pleasure objectified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall, for instance, the splendors of the external world and that best season of our climate,\n",
      "the long, slow-breathing autumn. What high pleasure we take in those hushed days of mid-November\n",
      "in the soft brown turf of the uplands, the fragrant smell of mellow earth and burning leaves,\n",
      "the purple haze that dims and magnifies the quiescent hills. Who is not strangely moved by\n",
      "that profound and brooding peace into which Nature then gathers up the multitudinous strivings,\n",
      "the myriad activities of her life? Who does not love to lie, in those slow-waning days upon\n",
      "the sands which hold within their golden cup the murmuring and dreaming sea? The very amplitude\n",
      "of the natural world, its far-flung grace and loveliness, spread out in rolling moor and winding\n",
      "stream and stately forest marching up the mountain-side, subdues and elevates the spirit of a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, so it has always been and so men have always longed to be the worshipers of beauty. Therefore\n",
      "they have believed in a conscious and eternal Spirit behind it. Because again we know that\n",
      "personality is the only thing we have of absolute worth. A man cannot, therefore, worship beauty,\n",
      "wholly relinquish himself to its high delights, if he conceives of this majestic grace as impersonal\n",
      "and inanimate. For that which we worship must be greater than we. Behind it, therefore, just\n",
      "because it seems to us so beautiful, must be something that calls to the hidden deeps of the\n",
      "soul, something intimately akin to our own spirits. So man worships not nature, but the God\n",
      "of nature; senses an Eternal Presence behind all gracious form. For that interprets beauty\n",
      "and consecrates the spell of beauty over us. This gives a final meaning to what the soul perceives\n",
      "is an utter loveliness. This gives to beauty an eternal and cosmic significance commensurate\n",
      "to its charm and power. As long as men's hearts surge, too, when the tide yearns up the beach;\n",
      "as long as their souls become articulate when the birds sing in the dawn, and the flowers lift\n",
      "themselves to the sun; so long will men believe that only from a supreme and conscious Loveliness,\n",
      "a joyous and a gracious Spirit could have come the beauty which is so intimately related to\n",
      "the spirit of a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not all saints and sinners are endowed with this joy and insight, this quick sensitiveness\n",
      "to beauty. Some of them cannot find the eternal and transcendent God in a loveliness which,\n",
      "by temperament, they either underrate or do not really see. There are a great many good people\n",
      "who cannot take beauty seriously. They become wooden and suspicious and uncomfortable whenever\n",
      "they are asked to perceive or enjoy a lovely object. Incredible though it seems, it appears\n",
      "to them to be unworthy of any final allegiance, any complete surrender, any unquestioning joy.\n",
      "But there are other ways in which they, too, may come to this sense of transcendence, other\n",
      "aspects of experience which also demand it. Most often it is just such folk who cannot perceive\n",
      "beauty, because they are practical or scientific or condemned to mean surroundings, who do\n",
      "feel to the full the grim force and terror of the external world. Prudence, caution, hard sense\n",
      "are to the fore with them! Very well; there, too, in these perceptions is an open door for\n",
      "the human spirit to transcend its environment, get out of its physical shell. The postulate\n",
      "of the absolute worth of beauty may be an argument for God drawn from subjective necessity.\n",
      "But the postulate of sovereign moral Being behind the tyranny and brutality of nature is an\n",
      "argument of objective necessity as well; here we all need God to explain the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "For we deal with what certainly appear to be objective aspects of the truth, when we regard\n",
      "ourselves in our relation to the might of the physical universe. For even as men feed upon\n",
      "its beauty, so they have found it necessary to discover something which should enable them\n",
      "to live above and unafraid of its material and gigantic power. We have already seen how there\n",
      "appears to be a cosmic hostility to human life which sobers indeed those who are intelligent\n",
      "enough to perceive it. It is only the fool or the brute or the sentimentalist who is unterrified\n",
      "by nature. The man of reflection and imagination sees his race crawling ant-like over its tiny\n",
      "speck of slowly cooling earth and surrounded by titanic and ruthless forces which threaten\n",
      "at any moment to engulf it. The religious man knows that he is infinitely greater than the\n",
      "beasts of the field or the clods of the highway. Yet Vesuvius belches forth its liquid fire\n",
      "and in one day of stark terror the great city which was full of men is become mute and desolate.\n",
      "The proud liner scrapes along the surface of the frozen berg and crumples like a ship of cards.\n",
      "There is a splash, a cry, a white face, a lifted arm, and then all the pride and splendor,\n",
      "all the hopes and fears, the gorgeous dreams, the daring thoughts are gone. But the ice floats\n",
      "on unscarred and undeterred and the ocean tosses and heaves just as it did before.\n",

      "Now, if this is all, if there is for us only the physical might of nature and the world is\n",
      "only what it seems to be; if there is no other God except such as can be found within this\n",
      "sort of cosmic process, then human life is a sardonic mockery, and self-respect a silly farce,\n",
      "and all the heroism of the heart and the valor of the mind the unmeaning activities of an insignificant\n",
      "atom. The very men who will naturally enter your churches are the ones who have always found\n",
      "that theory of life intolerable. It doesn't take in all the facts. They could not live by it\n",
      "and the soul of the race, looking out upon this universe of immeasurable material bulk, has\n",
      "challenged it and dared to assert its own superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "So by this road these men come back to the transcendent God without whom they cannot guard\n",
      "that integrity of personality which we are all set to keep. For here there is no way of believing\n",
      "in oneself, no way of enduring this world or our place in it and no tolerable way of understanding\n",
      "it except we look beneath this cosmic hostility and find our self-respect and a satisfying\n",
      "cosmic meaning in perceiving spiritual force, a conscious ethical purpose, which interpenetrates\n",
      "the thunder and the lightning, which lies behind the stars as they move in their perpetual\n",
      "courses. \"Through it the most ancient heavens are fresh and strong.\" Integrity of personality\n",
      "in such a world as this, belief in self, without which life is dust and ashes in the mouth,\n",
      "rest on the sublime assumption that suffusing material force is ethical spirit, more like unto\n",
      "us than it, controlling force in the interest of moral and eternal purposes. In these purposes\n",
      "living, not mechanical, forces play a major part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, to all such reasoning the Kantians and humanists reply that these notions of an\n",
      "objective and eternal beauty, of a transcendent and actual Cosmic Being exist within the mind.\n",
      "They are purely subjective ideas, they are bounded by the inexorable circle of our experience,\n",
      "hence they offer no proof of any objective reality which may in greater or less degree correspond\n",
      "to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there must be a \"source\" of these ideas. To which the philosophers reply, Yes, they\n",
      "are \"primitive and necessary,\" produced by reason only, without borrowing anything from the\n",
      "senses or the understanding. Yet there is no sufficient evidence that the idea of God is thus\n",
      "produced by any faculty of mind acting in entire freedom from external influence. On the contrary,\n",
      "the idea appears to owe much to the operation of external things upon the mind; it is not then\n",
      "the wholly unaffected product of reason. It is a response no less than an intuition. Like all\n",
      "knowledge a discovery, but the discovery of something there which could be discovered, hence,\n",
      "in that sense, a revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not necessary, then, for men to meet their situation in the cosmos by saying with Kant:\n",
      "We will act as though there were a God, although we are always conscious that we have no real\n",
      "knowledge of Him as an external being. In the light of the tragic circumstances of humanity,\n",
      "this is demanding the impossible. No sane body of men will ever get sufficient inspiration\n",
      "for life or find an adequate solution for the problem of life by resting upon mere value judgments\n",
      "which they propose, by an effort of will, to put in the place of genuine reality judgments.\n",
      "Indeed, there is a truly scholastic naÃ¯vetÃ©, a sort of solemn and unconscious humor, in seriously\n",
      "proposing that men should vitalize and consecrate their deepest purposes and most difficult\n",
      "experiences by hypothesizing mere appearances and illusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are we willing either to say with Santayana that all our sense of the beauty of the world\n",
      "is merely pleasure objectified and that we can infer no eternal Beauty from it. We are aware\n",
      "that there cannot be an immediate knowledge of a reality distinct from ourselves, that all\n",
      "our knowledge must be, in the nature of the case, an idea, a mental representation, that we\n",

      "our subjective ideas are formed under the influence of objects unknown but without us, produced\n",
      "by stimuli, real, if not perceived apart from our own consciousness, then we may say that what\n",
      "we have is a mediate or representative knowledge not only of an Eternal Being but formed under\n",
      "the influence of that Being. Nor does the believer ask for more. He does not expect to see\n",

      "But, of course, the preacher's main task is to interpret man's moral experience, which drives\n",
      "him out to search for the eternal in the terms of the \"other\" and redeeming God. We have spoken\n",
      "of the depersonalizing of religion which paganism and humanism alike have brought upon the\n",
      "world. One evidence of that has been the way in which we have confounded the social expressions\n",
      "of religion with its individual source. We are so concerned with the effect of our religion\n",
      "upon the community that we have forgotten that the heart of religion is found in the solitary\n",
      "soul. All of which means that we have here again yielded to the time spirit that enfolds us\n",
      "and have come to think of man as religious if he be humane. But that is not true. No man is\n",
      "ever religious until he becomes devout. And indeed no man of our sort--the saint and sinner\n",
      "sort--is ever long and truly humane unless the springs of his tenderness for men are found\n",

      "the living God until he understood that the central need in human life is to reconcile the\n",
      "individual conscience to itself, compose the anarchy of the spiritual life. Men want to be\n",
      "happy and be fed; but men must have inward peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "We swing back, therefore, to the native ground of preaching, approach the religious problem,\n",
      "now, not from the aesthetic or the scientific, but from the moral angle. Here we are dealing\n",
      "with the most poignant of all human experiences. For it is in this intensely personal world\n",
      "of moral failure and divided will that men are most acutely aware of themselves and hence of\n",
      "their need of that other-than-self beyond. The sentimental idealizing of contemporary life,\n",
      "the declension of the humanist's optimism into that superficial complacency which will not\n",
      "see what it does not like or what it is not expedient to see, makes one's mind to chuckle while\n",
      "one's heart doth ache. There is a brief heyday, its continuance dependent upon the uncontrollable\n",
      "factors of outward prosperity, physical and nervous vigor, capacity for preoccupation with\n",
      "the successive novelties of a diversified and complicated civilization, in which even men of\n",
      "religious temperament can minimize or ignore, perhaps sincerely disbelieve in, their divided\n",
      "life. Sometimes we think we may sin and be done with it. But always in the end man must come\n",
      "back to this moral tragedy of the soul. Because sin will not be done with us when we are done\n",
      "with it. Every evil is evil to him that does it and sooner or later we are compelled to understand\n",
      "that to be a sinner is the sorest and most certain punishment for sinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the awakening begins. Then can preaching stir the heart until deep answereth unto deep.\n",
      "It can talk of the struggle with moral temptation and weakness; of the unstable temperament\n",
      "which oscillates between the gutter and the stars; of the perversion or abuse of impulses good\n",
      "in themselves; of the dreadful dualism of the soul. For these are inheritances which have made\n",
      "life tragic in every generation for innumerable human beings. Whoever needed to explain to\n",
      "a company of grown men and women what the cry of the soul for its release from passion is?\n",
      "Every generation has its secret pessimists, brooding over the anarchy of the spirit, the issues\n",
      "of a distracted life. We need not ask with Faust, \"Where is that place which men call 'Hell'?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, it is from such central and poignant experiences as these that men have been constrained\n",
      "to look outward for a God. For these mark the very disintegration of personality, the utter\n",
      "dissipation of selfhood. That is the inescapable horror of sin. That is what we mean when we\n",
      "say sinners are lost; so they are, they are lost to their own selves. With what discriminating\n",
      "truth the father in the parable of the lost boy speaks. \"This, my son,\" he says, \"was dead\n",
      "though he is alive again.\" So it is with us; being is the price we pay for sinning. The more\n",
      "we do wrong the less we are. How then shall we become alive again?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is out of the shame and passion, the utter need of the human heart, which such considerations\n",
      "show to be real that men have built up their redemptive faiths. For all moral victory is conditioned\n",
      "upon help from without. To be sure each will and soul must strive desperately, even unto death,\n",
      "yet all that strife shall be in vain unless One stoops down from above and wrestles with us\n",
      "in the conflict. For the sinner must have two things, both of them beyond his unaided getting,\n",
      "or he will die. He must be released from his captivity. Who does not know the terrible restlessness,\n",
      "that grows and feeds upon itself and then does grow some more, of the man bound by evil and\n",
      "wanting to get out? The torture of sin is that it deprives us of the power to express ourselves.\n",
      "The cry of moral misery, therefore, is always the groaning of the prisoner. Oh, for help to\n",
      "break the bars of my intolerable and delicious sin that I may be myself once more! Oh, for\n",
      "some power greater than I which, being greater, can set me free!\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than the sinner wants to be free does he want to be kept. Along with the passion for\n",
      "liberty is the desire for surrender. Again, then, he wants something outside himself, some\n",
      "Being so far above the world he lives in that it can take him, the whole of him, break his\n",
      "life, shake it to its foundations, then pacify, compose it, make it anew. He is so tired of\n",
      "his sin; he is so weary with striving; he wants to relinquish it all; get far away from what\n",
      "he is; flee like a bird to the mountain; lay down his life before the One like whom he would\n",
      "be. So he wants power, he wants peace. He would be himself, he would lose himself. He prays\n",
      "for freedom, he longs for captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, out of these depths of human life, these vast antinomies of the spirit, has arisen man's\n",
      "belief in a Saviour-God. Sublime and awful are the sanctions upon which it rests. Out of the\n",
      "extremity and definiteness of our need we know that He must be and we know what He must be\n",
      "like. He is the One to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, from whom no secrets are\n",
      "hid. Who could state the mingling of desire and dread with which men strive after, and hide\n",
      "from, such a God? We want Him, yet until we have Him how we fear Him. For that inclusive knowledge\n",
      "of us which is God, if only we can bear to come to it, endows us with freedom. For then all\n",
      "the barriers are down, there is nothing to conceal, nothing to explain, nothing to hold back.\n",

      "for men of religion, is that Jesus is of God, that He belongs to Him. His chief office for\n",

      "of the Eternal Spirit, his desire to escape from time into reality, may be fulfilled in Jesus.\n",

      "the absolute Meeter of an absolute need. Of such preaching of Jesus we have today very little.\n",
      "The pendulum has swung far to the left, to the other exclusive emphasis, too obviously influenced\n",
      "by the currents of the day. It was perhaps inevitable that He should for a time drop out of\n",

      "Him. He is indeed the pledge of what we may be, but how many of us would ever believe that\n",
      "pledge unless there was something else in Him, more than we, that guaranteed it? What, as President\n",
      "Tucker asks, is this power which shall make \"maybe\" into \"is\" for us? \"Without doubt the trend\n",
      "of modern thought and faith is toward the more perfect identification of Christ with humanity.\n",

      "\n",
      "We begin, then, in this chapter, not with preaching, but with worship. It seems to me clear\n",
      "that the chief office of the church is liturgical rather than homiletical. Or, if that is too\n",
      "technical a statement, it may be said that the church exists to set forth and foster the religious\n",
      "life and that, because of the nature of that life, it finds its chief opportunity for so doing\n",
      "in the imaginative rather than the rationalizing or practical areas of human expression. Even\n",
      "as Michael Angelo, at the risk of his life, purloined dead bodies that he might dissect them\n",
      "and learn anatomy, so all disciples of the art of religion need the discipline of intellectual\n",
      "analysis and of knowledge of the facts of the religious experience if they are to be leaders\n",
      "in faith. There is a toughness of fiber needed in religious people that can only come through\n",
      "such mental discipline. But anatomists are not sculptors. Michael Angelo was the genius, the\n",
      "creative artist, not because he understood anatomy, but chiefly because of those as yet indefinable\n",
      "and secret processes of feeling and intuition in man, which made him feel rather than understand\n",
      "the pity and the terror, the majesty and the pathos of the human spirit and reveal them in\n",
      "significant and expressive line. Knowledge supported rather than rivaled insight. In the same\n",
      "way, both saint and sinner need religious instruction. Nevertheless they are what they are\n",
      "because they are first perceptive rather than reasoning beings. They both owe, the one his\n",
      "salvation, the other his despair, to the fact that they have seen the vision of the holy universe.\n",
      "Both are seers; the saint has given his allegiance to the heavenly vision. The sinner has resolved\n",
      "to be disobedient unto it. Both find their first and more natural approach to religious truth,\n",
      "therefore, through the creative rather than the critical processes, the emotional rather than\n",
      "the informative powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, of course, many in our churches who would dissent from this opinion. It is characteristic\n",
      "of Protestantism, as of humanism in general, that it lays its chief emphasis upon the intelligence.\n",
      "If we go to church to practice the presence of God, must we not first know who and what this\n",
      "God is whose presence with us we are there asked to realize? So most Protestant services are\n",
      "more informative than inspirational. Their attendants are assembled to hear about God rather\n",
      "to taste and see that the Lord is good. They analyze the religious experience rather than enjoy\n",
      "it; insensibly they come to regard the spiritual life as a proposition to be proved, not a\n",
      "power to be appropriated. Hence our services generally consist of some \"preliminary exercises,\"\n",
      "as we ourselves call them, leading up to the climax--when it is a climax--of the sermon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a major cause for the declension of the influence of Protestant church services. They\n",
      "go too much on the assumption that men already possess religion and that they come to church\n",
      "to discuss it rather than to have it provided. They call men to be listeners rather than participants\n",
      "in their temples. Of course, one may find God through the mind. The great scholar, the mathematician\n",
      "or the astronomer may cry with Kepler, \"Behold, I think the thoughts of God after him!\" Yet\n",
      "a service which places its chief emphasis upon the appeal to the will through instruction has\n",
      "declined from that realm of the absolutes where religion in its purest form belongs. For since\n",
      "preaching makes its appeal chiefly through reason, it thereby attempts to produce only a partial\n",
      "and relative experience in the life of the listener. It impinges upon the will by a slow process.\n",
      "Sometimes one gets so deadly weary of preaching because, in a world like ours, the reasonable\n",
      "process is so unreasonable. That's a half truth, of course, but one that the modern world needs\n",
      "to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others would dissent from our position by saying that service, the life of good will, is a\n",
      "sufficient worship. The highest adoration is to visit the widows and the fatherless in their\n",
      "affliction. Laborare est orare. What we do speaks so loud God does not care for what we say.\n",
      "True: but the value of what we do for God depends upon the godliness of the doer and where\n",
      "shall he find that godliness save in the secret place of the Most High? And the greatest gift\n",
      "we can give our fellows is to bring them into the divine presence. \"There is,\" says Dr. William\n",
      "Adams Brown, \"a service that is directed to the satisfaction of needs already in existence,\n",
      "and there is a service that is itself the creator of new needs which enlarge the capacity of\n",
      "the man to whom it would minister. To this larger service religion is committed, and the measure\n",
      "of a man's fitness to render it is his capacity for worship.\" But no one can give more than\n",
      "he has. If we are to offer such gifts we must ourselves go before and lead. To create the atmosphere\n",
      "in which the things of righteousness and holiness seem to be naturally exalted above the physical,\n",
      "the commercial, the domestic affairs of men; to lift the level of thought and feeling to that\n",
      "high place where the spiritual consciousness contributes its insights and finds a magnanimous\n",
      "utterance--is there anything that our world needs more? There are noble and necessary ministries\n",
      "to the body and the mind, but most needed, and least often offered, there is a ministry to\n",
      "the human spirit. This is the gift which the worshiper can bring. This is the true and central\n",
      "knowledge that private devotion and public worship alone can give; preaching can but conserve\n",
      "and transmit this religious experience through the mind, worship creates it in the heart. Edwards\n",
      "understood that neither thought nor conduct can take its place. \"The sober performance of moral\n",
      "duty,\" said he, \"is no substitute for passionate devotion to a Being with its occasional moments\n",
      "of joy and exaltation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We should then begin with worship. A church which does not emphasize it before everything else\n",
      "is trying to build the structure of a spiritual society with the corner stone left out. Let\n",
      "us try, first of all, to define it. An old and popular definition of the descriptive sort says\n",
      "that \"worship is the response of the soul to the consciousness of being in the presence of\n",
      "God.\" A more modern definition, analyzing the psychology of worship, defines it as \"the unification\n",
      "of consciousness around the central controlling idea of God, the prevailing emotional tone\n",
      "being that of adoration.\" Evidently we mean, then, by worship the appeal to the religious will\n",
      "through feeling and the imagination. Worship is therefore essentially creative. Every act of\n",
      "worship seeks to bring forth then and there a direct experience of God through high and concentrated\n",
      "emotion. It fixes the attention upon Him as an object in Himself supremely desirable. The result\n",
      "of this unified consciousness is peace and the result of this peace and harmony is a new sense\n",
      "of power. Worship, then, is the attainment of that inward wholeness for which in one form or\n",
      "another all religion strives by means of contemplation. So by its very nature it belongs to\n",
      "the class of the absolutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many psychologies of religion define this contemplation as aesthetic, and make worship a higher\n",
      "form of delight. This appears to me a quite typical non-religious interpretation of a religious\n",
      "experience. There are four words which need explaining when we talk of worship. They are: wonder,\n",
      "admiration, awe, reverence. Wonder springs from the recognition of the limitations of our knowledge;\n",
      "it is an experience of the mind. Admiration is the response of a growing intelligence to beauty,\n",
      "partly an aesthetic, partly an intellectual experience. These distinctions Coleridge had in\n",
      "mind in his well-known sentence \"In wonder all philosophy began; in wonder it ends; and admiration\n",
      "fills up the interspace. But the first wonder is the offspring of ignorance; the last is the\n",
      "parent of adoration.\" Awe is the sense-perception of the stupendous power and magnitude of\n",
      "the universe; it is, quite literally, a godly fear. But it is not ignoble nor cringing, it\n",
      "is just and reasonable, the attitude, toward the Whole, of a comprehensive sanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus \"I would love Thee, O God, if there were no heaven, and if there were no hell, I would\n",
      "fear Thee no less.\" Reverence is devotion to goodness, sense of awe-struck loyalty to a Being\n",
      "manifestly under the influence of principles higher than our own.[41] Now it is with these\n",
      "last two, awe and reverence, rather than wonder and admiration, that worship has to do.\n",

      "Hence the essence of worship is not aesthetic contemplation. Without doubt worship does gratify\n",
      "the aesthetic instinct and most properly so. There is no normal expression of man's nature\n",
      "which has not its accompanying delight. The higher and more inclusive the expression the more\n",
      "exquisite, of course, the delight. But that pleasure is the by-product, not the object, of\n",
      "worship. It itself springs partly from the awe of the infinite and eternal majesty which induces\n",
      "the desire to prostrate oneself before the Lord our Maker. It also springs partly from passionate\n",
      "devotion of a loyal will to a holy Being. \"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand\n",
      "of their masters and as the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait\n",
      "upon the Lord.\" Thus reverence is the high and awe-struck hunger for spiritual communion. \"My\n",
      "soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a noble illustration of the nature and the uses of worship in the Journals of Jonathan\n",
      "Edwards, distinguished alumnus of Yale College, and the greatest mind this hemisphere has produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every element of worship is contained in this description. First, we have a young human\n",
      "being emotionally conscious of the presence of God, who in some way or other directly but invisibly\n",
      "comes to her. Secondly, we have her attention so fixed on the adoration of God that she hardly\n",
      "cares for anything except to meditate upon Him. Thirdly, as the result of this worshipful approach\n",
      "to religious reality, we have the profound peace and harmony, the summum bonum of existence,\n",
      "coupled with strong moral purpose which characterize her life. Here, then, is evidently the\n",
      "unification of consciousness in happy awe and the control of destiny through meditation upon\n",
      "infinite matters, that is, through reverent contemplation of God. Is it not one of those ironies\n",
      "of history wherewith fate is forever mocking and teasing the human spirit, that the grandson\n",
      "of this lady and of Jonathan Edwards should have been Aaron Burr?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, then, the end of worship is to present to the mind, through the imagination, one idea,\n",
      "majestic and inclusive. So it presents it chiefly through high and sustained feeling. Worship\n",
      "proceeds on the understanding that one idea, remaining almost unchanged and holding the attention\n",
      "for a considerable length of time, so directs the emotional processes that thought and action\n",
      "are harmonized with it. If one reads the great prayers of the centuries they indicate, for\n",
      "the most part, an unconscious understanding of this psychology of worship. Take, for instance,\n",
      "this noble prayer of Pusey's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me not seek out of Thee what I can find only in Thee, O Lord, peace and rest and joy and\n",
      "bliss, which abide only in thine abiding joy. Lift up my soul above the weary round of harassing\n",
      "thoughts, to Thy eternal presence. Lift up my soul to the pure, bright, serene, radiant atmosphere\n",
      "of Thy presence, that there I may breathe freely, there repose in Thy love, there be at rest\n",
      "from myself and from all things that weary me, and thence return arrayed with Thy peace, to\n",
      "do and bear what shall please Thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This prayer expresses the essence of worship which is the seeking, through the fixation of\n",
      "attention, not the delight but rather the peace and purity which can only be found in the consciousness\n",
      "of God. This peace is the necessary outcome of the indwelling presence. It ensues when man\n",
      "experiences the radiant atmosphere of the divine communion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same clear expression of worship is found in another familiar and noble prayer, that of\n",
      "Johann Arndt. Here, too, are phrases descriptive of a unified consciousness induced by reverent\n",
      "loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Lord, to whom all hearts are open, Thou canst govern the vessel of my soul far better\n",
      "than can I. Arise, O Lord, and command the stormy wind and the troubled sea of my heart to\n",
      "be still, and at peace in Thee, that I may look up to Thee undisturbed and abide in union with\n",
      "Thee, my Lord. Let me not be carried hither and thither by wandering thoughts, but forgetting\n",
      "all else let me see and hear Thee. Renew my spirit, kindle in me Thy light that it may shine\n",
      "within me, and my heart burn in love and adoration for Thee. Let Thy Holy Spirit dwell in me\n",
      "continually, and make me Thy temple and sanctuary, and fill me with divine love and life and\n",
      "light, with devout and heavenly thoughts, with comfort and strength, with joy and peace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus here one sees in the high contemplation of a transcendent God the subduing and elevating\n",
      "of the human will, the restoration and composure of the moral life. Finally, in a prayer of\n",
      "St. Anselm's there is a sort of analysis of the process of worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O God, Thou art life, wisdom, truth, bounty and blessedness, the eternal, the only true Good.\n",
      "My God and my Lord, Thou art my hope and my heart's joy. I confess with thanksgiving that Thou\n",
      "hast made me in Thine image, that I may direct all my thoughts to Thee and love Thee. Lord,\n",
      "make me to know Thee aright that I may more and more love and enjoy and possess Thee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One cannot conclude these examples of worshipful expression without quoting a prayer of Augustine,\n",
      "which is, I suppose, the most perfect brief petition in all the Christian literature of devotion\n",
      "and which gives the great psychologist's perception of the various steps in the unification\n",
      "of the soul with the eternal Spirit through sublime emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grant, O God, that we may desire Thee, and desiring Thee, seek Thee, and seeking Thee, find\n",
      "Thee, and finding Thee, be satisfied with Thee forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think one may see, then, why worship as distinct from preaching, or the hearing of preaching,\n",
      "is the first necessity of the religious life. It unites us as nothing else can do with God\n",
      "the whole and God the transcendent. The conception of God is the sum total of human needs and\n",
      "desires harmonized, unified, concretely expressed. It is the faith of the worshiper that this\n",
      "concept is derived from a real and objective Being in some way corresponding to it. No one\n",
      "can measure the influence of such an idea when it dominates the consciousness of any given\n",
      "period. It can create and set going new desires and habits, it can minish and repress old ones,\n",
      "because this idea carries, with its transcendent conception, the dynamic quality which belongs\n",
      "to the idea of perfect power. But this transcendent conception, being essentially of something\n",
      "beyond, without and above ourselves can only be \"realized\" through the feeling and the imagination,\n",
      "whose province it is to deal with the supersensuous values, with the fringes of understanding,\n",
      "with the farthest bounds of knowledge. These make the springboard, so to speak, from which\n",
      "man dares to launch himself into that sea of the infinite, which we can neither understand\n",
      "nor measure, but which nevertheless we may perceive and feel, which in some sense we know to\n",
      "be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if we deal first with worship, we are merely beginning at the beginning and starting at\n",
      "the bottom. And, in the light of this observation, it is appalling to survey the non-liturgical\n",
      "churches today and see the place that public devotion holds in them. It is not too much, I\n",
      "think, to speak of the collapse of worship in Protestant communities. No better evidence of\n",
      "this need be sought than in the nature of the present attempts to reinstate it. They have a\n",
      "naÃ¯vetÃ©, an incongruity, that can only be explained on the assumption of their impoverished\n",
      "background.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation shows first in the heterogeneous character of our experiments. We are continually\n",
      "printing on our churches' calendars what we usually call \"programs,\" but which are meant to\n",
      "be orders of worship. We are also forever changing them. There is nothing inevitable about\n",
      "their order; they have no intelligible, self-verifying procedure. Anthems are inserted here\n",
      "and there without any sense of the progression or of the psychology of worship. Glorias are\n",
      "sung sometimes with the congregation standing up and sometimes while they are sitting down.\n",
      "There is no lectionary to determine a comprehensive and orderly reading of Scripture, not much\n",
      "sequence of thought or progress of devotion either in the read or the extempore prayers. There\n",
      "is no uniformity of posture. There are two historic attitudes of reverence when men are addressing\n",
      "the Almighty. They are the standing upon one's feet or the falling upon one's knees. For the\n",
      "most part we neither stand nor kneel; we usually loll. Some of us compromise by bending forward\n",
      "to the limiting of our breath and the discomfort of our digestion. It is too little inducive\n",
      "to physical ease or perhaps too derogatory to our dignity to kneel before the Lord our Maker.\n",
      "All this seems too much like the efforts of those who have forgotten what worship really is\n",
      "and are trying to find for it some comfortable or attractive substitute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: we show our inexperience by betraying the confusion of aesthetic and ethical values\n",
      "as we strive for variety and entertainment in church services; we build them around wonder\n",
      "and admiration, not around reverence and awe. But we are mistaken if we suppose that men chiefly\n",
      "desire to be pleasantly entertained or extraordinarily delighted when they go into a church.\n",
      "They go there because they desire to enter a Holy Presence; they want to approach One before\n",
      "whom they can be still and know that He is God. All \"enrichments\" of a service injected into\n",
      "it here and there, designed to make it more attractive, to add color and variety, to arrest\n",
      "the attention of the senses are, as ends, beside the point, and our dependence upon them indicates\n",
      "the unhappy state of worship in our day. That we do thus make our professional music an end\n",
      "in itself is evident from our blatant way of advertising it. In the same way we advertise sermon\n",
      "themes, usually intended to startle the pious and provoke the ungodly. We want to arouse curiosity,\n",
      "social or political interest, to achieve some secular reaction. We don't advertise that tomorrow\n",
      "in our church there is to be a public worship of God, and that everything that we are going\n",
      "to do will be in the awe-struck sense that He is there. We are afraid that nobody would come\n",
      "if we merely did that!\n",
      "\n",
      "What infidels we are! Why are we surprised that the world is passing us by? We say and we sing\n",
      "a great many things which it is incredible to suppose we would address to God if we really\n",
      "thought He were present. Yet anthems and congregational singing are either a sacrifice solemnly\n",
      "and joyously offered to God or else all the singing is less, and worse, than nothing in a church\n",
      "service. But how often sentimental and restless music, making not for restraint and reverence,\n",
      "not for the subduing of mind and heart but for the expression of those expansive and egotistical\n",
      "moods which are of the essence of romantic singing, is what we employ. There is a great deal\n",
      "of truly religious music, austere in tone, breathing restraint and reverence, quietly written.\n",
      "The anthems of Palestrina, Anerio, Viadana, Vittoria among the Italians; of Bach, Haydn, Handel,\n",
      "Mozart among the Germans; and of Tallis, Gibbons and Purcell among the English, are all of\n",
      "the truly devout order. Yet how seldom are the works of such men heard in our churches, even\n",
      "where they employ professional singers at substantial salaries. We are everywhere now trying\n",
      "to give our churches splendid and impressive physical accessories, making the architecture\n",
      "more and more stately and the pews more and more comfortable! Thus we attempt an amalgam of\n",
      "a mediaeval house of worship with an American domestic interior, adoring God at our ease, worshiping\n",
      "Him in armchairs, offering prostration of the spirit, so far as it can be achieved along with\n",
      "indolence of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we advertise and concertize and have silver vases and costly flowers and conventional ecclesiastical\n",
      "furniture. But we still hold a \"small-and-early\" in the vestibule before service and a \"five\n",
      "o'clock\" in the chapel afterward. Sunday morning church is a this-world function with a pietized\n",
      "gossip and a decorous sort of sociable with an intellectual fillip thrown in. Thus we try to\n",
      "make our services attractive to the secular instincts, the non-religious things, in man's nature.\n",
      "We try to get him into the church by saying, \"You will find here what you find elsewhere.\"\n",
      "It's rather illogical. The church stands for something different. We say, \"You will like to\n",
      "come and be one of us because we are not different.\" The answer is, \"I can get the things of\n",
      "this world better in the world, where they belong, than with you.\" Thus we have naturalized\n",
      "our very offices of devotion! Hence the attempts to revive worship are incongruous and inconsistent.\n",
      "Hence they have that sentimental and accidental character which is the sign of the amateur.\n",
      "They do not bring us very near to the heavenly country. It might be well to remember that the\n",
      "servant of Jahweh doth not cry nor lift up his voice nor cause it to be heard in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are many reasons for this anomalous situation. One of them is our inheritance of\n",
      "a deep-rooted Puritan distrust of a liturgical service. That distrust is today a fetish and\n",
      "therefore much more potent that it was when it was a reason. Puritanism was born in the Reformation;\n",
      "it came out from the Roman church, where worship was regarded as an end in itself. To Catholic\n",
      "believers worship is a contribution to God, pleasing to Him apart from any effect it may have\n",
      "on the worshiper. Such a theory of it is, of course, open to grave abuse. Sometimes it led\n",
      "to indifference as to the effect of the worship upon the moral character of the communicant,\n",
      "so that worship could be used, not to conquer evil, but to make up for it, and thus sin became\n",
      "as safe as it was easy. Inevitably also such a theory of worship often degenerated into an\n",
      "utter formalism which made hyprocrisy and unreality patent, until the hoc est corpus of the\n",
      "mass became the hocus-pocus of the scoffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a reason, once valid because moral, for our present situation. Yet it must be confessed\n",
      "that again, as so often, we are doing what the Germans call \"throwing out the baby with the\n",
      "bath,\" namely, repudiating a defect or the perversion of an excellence and, in so doing, throwing\n",
      "away that excellence itself. It is clear that no Protestant is ever tempted today to consider\n",
      "worship as its own reason and its own end. We are, in a sense, utilitarian ritualists. Worship\n",
      "to us is as valuable as it is valid because it is the chief avenue of spiritual insight, a\n",
      "chief means of awakening penitence, obtaining forgiveness, growing in grace and love. These\n",
      "are the ultimates; these are pleasing to God.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second reason, however, for our situation is not ethical and essential, but economic and\n",
      "accidental. Our fathers' communities were a slender chain of frontier settlements, separated\n",
      "from an ancient civilization by an unknown and dangerous sea on the one hand, menaced by all\n",
      "the perils of a virgin wilderness upon the other. All their life was simple to the point of\n",
      "bareness; austere, reduced to the most elemental necessities. Inevitably the order of their\n",
      "worship corresponded to the order of their society. It is certain, I think, that the white\n",
      "meeting-house with its naked dignity, the old service with its heroic simplicity, conveyed\n",
      "to the primitive society which produced them elements both of high formality and conscious\n",
      "reverence which they could not possibly offer to our luxurious, sophisticated and wealthy age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not a dangerous thing to have brought an ever increasing formality and recognition of\n",
      "a developed and sophisticated community into our social and intellectual life but to have allowed\n",
      "our religious expression to remain so anachronistic? Largely for social and economic reasons\n",
      "we send most of our young men and young women to college. There we deliberately cultivate in\n",
      "them the perception of beauty, the sense of form, various expressions of the imaginative life.\n",
      "But how much has our average non-liturgical service to offer to their critically trained perceptions?\n",
      "Our church habits are pretty largely the transfer into the sanctuary of the hearty conventions\n",
      "of middle-class family life. The relations in life which are precious to such youth, the intimate,\n",
      "the mystical and subtle ones, get small recognition or expression. A hundred agencies outside\n",
      "the church are stimulating in the best boys and girls of the present generation fine sensibilities,\n",
      "critical standards, the higher hungers. Our services, chiefly instructive and didactic, informal\n",
      "and easy in character, irritate them and make them feel like truculent or uncomfortable misfits.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third reason for the lack of corporate or public offices of devotion in our services lies\n",
      "in the intellectual character of the Protestant centuries. We have seen how they have been\n",
      "centuries of individualism. Character has been conceived of as largely a personal affair expressed\n",
      "in personal relationships. The believer was like Christian in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.\n",
      "He started for the Heavenly Country because he was determined to save his own soul. When he\n",
      "realized that he was living in the City of Destruction it did not occur to him that, as a good\n",
      "man, he must identify his fate with it. On the contrary, he deserted wife and children with\n",
      "all possible expedition and got him out and went along through the Slough of Despond, up to\n",
      "the narrow gate, to start on the way of life. It was a chief glory of mediaeval society that\n",
      "it was based upon corporate relationships. Its cathedrals were possible because they were the\n",
      "common house of God for every element of the community. Family and class and state were dominant\n",
      "factors then. But we have seen how, in the Renaissance and the Romantic Movement, individualism\n",
      "supplanted these values. Now, Protestantism was contemporary with that new movement, indeed,\n",
      "a part of it. Its growing egotism and the colossal egotism of the modern world form a prime\n",
      "cause for the impoverishment of worship in Protestant churches.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so this brings us, then, to the real reason for our devotional impotence, the one to which\n",
      "we referred in the opening sentences of the chapter. It is essentially due to the character\n",
      "of the regulative ideas of our age. It lies in that world view whose expressions in literature,\n",
      "philosophy and social organizations we have been reviewing in these pages. The partial notion\n",
      "of God which our age has unconsciously made the substitute for a comprehensive understanding\n",
      "of Him is essentially to blame. For since the contemporary doctrine is of His immanence, it\n",
      "therefore follows that it is chiefly through observation of the natural world and by interpretation\n",
      "of contemporary events that men will approach Him if they come to Him at all. Moreover, our\n",
      "humanism, in emphasizing the individual and exalting his self-sufficiency, has so far made\n",
      "the mood of worship alien and the need of it superfluous. The overemphasis upon preaching,\n",
      "the general passion of this generation for talk and then more talk, and then endless talk,\n",
      "is perfectly intelligible in view of the regulative ideas of this generation. It seeks its\n",
      "understanding of the world chiefly in terms of natural and tangible phenomena and chiefly by\n",
      "means either of critical observation or of analytic reasoning. Hence preaching, especially\n",
      "that sort which looks for the divine principle in contemporary events, has been to the fore.\n",
      "But worship, which finds the divine principle in something more and other than contemporary\n",
      "events--which indeed does not look outward to \"events\" at all--has been thrown into the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me clear, then, that if we are to emphasize the transcendent elements in religion;\n",
      "if they represent, as we have been contending, the central elements of the religious experience,\n",
      "its creative factors, then the revival of worship will be a prime step in creating a more truly\n",
      "spiritual society. I am convinced that a homilizing church belongs to a secularizing age. One\n",
      "cannot forget that the ultimate, I do not say the only, reason for the founding of the non-liturgical\n",
      "churches was the rise of humanism. One cannot fail to see the connection between humanistic\n",
      "doctrine and moralistic preaching, or between the naturalism of the moment and the mechanicalizing\n",
      "of the church. \"The Christian congregation,\" said Luther, child of the humanistic movement,\n",
      "\"should never assemble except the word of God be preached.\" \"In other countries,\" says old\n",
      "Isaac Taylor, \"the bell calls people to worship; in Scotland it calls them to a preachment.\"\n",
      "And one remembers the justice of Charles Kingsley's fling at the Dissenters that they were\n",
      "\"creatures who went to church to hear sermons!\" It would seem evident, then, that a renewal\n",
      "of worship would be the logical accompaniment of a return to distinctly religious values in\n",
      "society and church.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can we do, then, better for an age of paganism than to cultivate this transcendent consciousness?\n",
      "Direct men away from God the universal and impersonal to God the particular and intimate. Nothing\n",
      "is more needed for our age than to insist upon the truth that there are both common and uncommon,\n",
      "both secular and sacred worlds; that these are not contradictory; that they are complementary;\n",
      "that they are not identical. It is the church's business to insist that men must live in the\n",
      "world of the sacred, the uncommon, the particular, in order to be able to surmount and endure\n",
      "the secular, the common and the universal. It is her business to insist that through worship\n",
      "all this can be accomplished. But can worship be taught? Is not the devotee, like the poet\n",
      "or the lover or any other genius, born and not made? Well, whether it can be taught or not,\n",
      "it at least can be cultivated and developed, and there are three very practical ways in which\n",
      "this cultivation can be brought about.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them is by paying intelligent attention to the physical surroundings of the worshiper.\n",
      "The assembly room for worship obviously should not be used for other purposes; all its suggestions\n",
      "and associations should be of one sort and that sort the highest. Quite aside from the question\n",
      "of taste, it is psychologically indefensible to use the same building, and especially the same\n",
      "room in the building, for concerts, for picture shows, for worship. Here we at once create\n",
      "a distracted consciousness; we dissipate attention; we deliberately make it harder for men\n",
      "and women to focus upon one, and that the most difficult, if the most precious, mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the same reason, the physical form of the room should be one that does not suggest either\n",
      "the concert hall or the playhouse, but suggests rather a long and unbroken ecclesiastical tradition.\n",
      "Until the cinema was introduced into worship, we were vastly improving in these respects, but\n",
      "now we are turning the morning temple into an evening showhouse. I think we evince a most impertinent\n",
      "familiarity with the house of God! And too often the church is planned so that it has no privacies\n",
      "or recesses, but a hideous publicity pervades its every part. We adorn it with stenciled frescoes\n",
      "of the same patterns which we see in hotel lobbies and clubs; we hang up maps behind the reading\n",
      "desk; we clutter up its platform with grand pianos.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a mere matter of good taste and good psychology to begin our preparation for a ministry\n",
      "of worship by changing all this. There should be nothing in color or ornament which arouses\n",
      "the restless mood or distracts the eye. Severe and simple walls, restrained and devout figures\n",
      "in glass windows, are only to be tolerated. Descriptive windows, attempting in a most untractable\n",
      "medium a sort of naÃ¯ve realism, are equally an aesthetic and an ecclesiastical offense. Figures\n",
      "of saints or great religious personages should be typical, impersonal, symbolic, not too much\n",
      "like this world and the things of it. There is a whole school of modern window glass distinguished\n",
      "by its opulence and its realism. It ought to be banished from houses of worship. Since it is\n",
      "the object of worship to fix the attention upon one thing and that thing the highest, the room\n",
      "where worship is held should have its own central object. It may be the Bible, idealized as\n",
      "the word of God; it may be the altar on which stands the Cross of the eternal sacrifice. But\n",
      "no church ought to be without one fixed point to which the eye of the body is insensibly drawn,\n",
      "thereby making it easier to follow it with the attention of the mind and the wishes of the\n",
      "heart. At the best, our Protestant ecclesiastical buildings are all empty! There are meeting-houses,\n",
      "not temples assembly rooms, not shrines. There is apparently no sense in which we are willing\n",
      "to acknowledge that the Presence is on their altar. But at least the attention of the worshiper\n",
      "within them may focus around some symbol of that Presence, may be fixed on some outward sign\n",
      "which will help the inward grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "But second: our chief concern naturally must be with the content of the service of worship\n",
      "itself, not with its physical surroundings. And here then are two things which may be said.\n",
      "First, any formal order of worship should be historic; it should have its roots deep in the\n",
      "past; whatever else is true of a service of worship it ought not to suggest that it has been\n",
      "uncoupled from the rest of time and allowed to run wild. Now, this means that an order of worship,\n",
      "basing itself on the devotion of the ages, will use to some extent their forms. I do not see\n",
      "how anyone would wish to undertake to lead the same company of people week by week in divine\n",
      "worship without availing himself of the help of written prayers, great litanies, to strengthen\n",
      "and complement the spontaneous offices of devotion. There is something almost incredible to\n",
      "me in the assumption that one man can, supposedly unaided, lead a congregation in the emotional\n",
      "expression of its deepest life and desires without any assistance from the great sacramentaries\n",
      "and liturgies of the past. Christian literature is rich with a great body of collects, thanksgivings,\n",
      "confessions, various special petitions, which gather up the love and tears, the vision and\n",
      "the anguish of many generations. These, with their phrases made unspeakably precious with immemorial\n",
      "association, with their subtle fitting of phrase to insight, of expression to need, born of\n",
      "long centuries of experiment and aspiration, can do for a congregation what no man alone can\n",
      "ever hope to accomplish. The well of human needs and desires is so deep that, without these\n",
      "aids, we have not much to draw with, no plummet wherewith to sound its dark and hidden depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt if we can overestimate the importance of giving this sense of continuity in petitions,\n",
      "of linking up the prayer of the moment and the worship of the day with the whole ageless process\n",
      "so that it seems a part of that volume of human life forever ascending unto the eternal spirit,\n",
      "just as the gray plume of smoke from the sacrifice ever curled upward morning by morning and\n",
      "night by night from the altar of the temple under the blue Syrian sky. We cannot easily give\n",
      "this sense of continuity, this prestige of antiquity, this resting back on a great body of\n",
      "experience, unless we know and use the language and the phrases of our fathers. It is to the\n",
      "God who hath been our dwelling place in all generations, that we pray; to Him who in days of\n",
      "old was a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night to His faithful children; to the One\n",
      "who is the Ancient of Days, Infinite Watcher of the sons of men. Only by acquaintance with\n",
      "the phrases, the petitions of the past, and only by a liberal use of them can we give background\n",
      "and dignity, or anything approaching variety and completeness, to our own public expression\n",
      "and interpretation of the devotional life. If anyone objects to this use of formal prayers\n",
      "on the ground of their formality, let him remember that we, too, are formal, only we, alas,\n",
      "have made a cult of formlessness. It would surprise the average minister to know the well-worn\n",
      "road which his supposedly spontaneous and extempore devotions follow. Phrase after phrase following\n",
      "in the same order of ideas, and with the same pitiably limited vocabulary, appear week by week\n",
      "in them. How much better to enrich this painfully individualistic formalism with something\n",
      "of the corporate glories of the whole body of Christian believers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, second: there should be also the principle of immediacy in the service, room for the expression\n",
      "of individual needs and desires and for reference to the immediate and local circumstances\n",
      "of the believer. A church in which there is no spontaneous and extempore prayer, which only\n",
      "harked backward to the past, might build the tombs of the prophets but it might also stifle\n",
      "new voices for a new age. But extempore prayer should not be impromptu prayer. It should have\n",
      "coherence, dignity, progression. The spirit should have been humbly and painstakingly prepared\n",
      "for it so that sincere and ardent feeling may wing and vitalize its words. The great prayers\n",
      "of the ages, known of all the worshipers, perhaps repeated by them all together, tie in the\n",
      "individual soul to the great mass of humanity and it moves on, with its fellows, toward salvation\n",
      "as majestically and steadily as great rivers flow. The extempore and silent prayer, not unpremeditated\n",
      "but still the unformed outpouring of the individual heart, gives each man the consciousness\n",
      "of standing naked and alone before his God. Both these, the corporate and the separate elements\n",
      "of worships are vital; there should be a place for each in every true order of worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, the final thing to say is the first thing. Whatever may be the means that worship\n",
      "employs, its purpose must be to make and keep the church a place of repose, to induce constantly\n",
      "the life of relinquishment to God, of reverence and meditation. And this it will do as it seeks\n",
      "to draw men up to the \"otherness,\" the majesty, the aloofness, the transcendence of the Almighty.\n",
      "To this end I would use whatever outward aids time and experience have shown will strengthen\n",
      "and deepen the spiritual understanding. I should not fear to use the cross, the sacraments,\n",
      "the kneeling posture, the great picture, the carving, the recitation of prayers and hymns,\n",
      "not alone to intensify this sense in the believer but equally to create it in the non-believer.\n",
      "The external world moulds the internal, even as the internal makes the external. If these things\n",
      "mean little in the beginning, there is still truth in the assertion of the devotee that if\n",
      "you practice them they will begin to mean something to you. This is not merely that a meaning\n",
      "will be self-induced. It is more than that. They will put us in the volitional attitude, the\n",
      "emotional mood, where the meaning is able to penetrate. Just as all the world acknowledges\n",
      "that there is an essential connection between good manners and good morals, between military\n",
      "discipline and physical courage, so there is a connection between a devotional service and\n",
      "the gifts of the spiritual life. Such a service not merely strengthens belief in the High and\n",
      "Holy One, it has a real office in creating, in making possible, that belief itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall sum it all up if we say in one word that the offices of devotion emphasize the cosmic\n",
      "character of religion. They take us out of the world of moral theism into the world of a universal\n",
      "theism. They draw us away from religion in action to religion in itself; they give us, not\n",
      "the God of this world, but the God who is from everlasting to everlasting, to whom a thousand\n",
      "years are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night. Thus they help us to\n",
      "make for ourselves an interior refuge into whose precincts no eye may look, into whose life\n",
      "no other soul may venture. In that refuge we can be still and know that He is God. There we\n",
      "can eat the meat which the world knoweth not of, there have peace with Him. It is in these\n",
      "central solitudes, induced by worship, that the vision is clarified, the perspective corrected,\n",
      "the vital forces recharged. Those who possess them are transmitters of such heavenly messages;\n",
      "they issue from them as rivers pour from undiminished mountain streams. Does the world's sin\n",
      "and pain and weakness come and empty itself into the broad current of these devout lives? Then\n",
      "their fearless onsweeping forces gather it all up, carry it on, cleanse and purify it in the\n",
      "process. Over such lives the things of this world have no power. They are kept secretly from\n",

      "If one were to ask any sermon-taster of our generation what is the prevailing type of discourse\n",
      "among the better-known preachers of the day, he would probably answer, \"The expository.\" Expository\n",
      "preaching has had a notable revival in the last three decades, especially among liberal preachers;\n",
      "that is, among those who like ourselves have discarded scholastic theologies, turned to the\n",
      "ethical aspects of religion for our chief interests and accepted the modern view of the Bible.\n",
      "To be sure, it is not the same sort of expository preaching which made the Scottish pulpit\n",
      "of the nineteenth century famous. It is not the detailed exposition of each word and clause,\n",
      "almost of each comma, which marks the mingled insight and literalism of a Chalmers, an Alexander\n",
      "Maclaren, a Taylor of the Broadway Tabernacle. For that assumed a verbally inspired and hence\n",
      "an inerrant Scripture; it dealt with the literature of the Old and New Testaments as being\n",
      "divine revelations. The new expository preaching proceeds from almost an opposite point of\n",
      "view. It deals with this literature as being a transcript of human experience. Its method is\n",
      "direct and simple and, within sharp limits, very effective. The introduction to one of these\n",
      "modern expository sermons would run about as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose that what has given to the Old and New Testament Scriptures their enduring hold\n",
      "over the minds and consciences of men has been their extraordinary humanity. They contain so\n",
      "many vivid and accurate recitals of typical human experience, portrayed with self-verifying\n",
      "insight and interpreted with consummate understanding of the issues of the heart. And since\n",
      "it is true, as Goethe said, 'That while mankind is always progressing man himself remains ever\n",
      "the same,' and we are not essentially different from the folk who lived a hundred generations\n",
      "ago under the sunny Palestinian sky, we read these ancient tales and find in them a mirror\n",
      "which reflects the lineaments of our own time. For instance,...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the sermonizer proceeds to relate some famous Bible story, resolving its naÃ¯ve Semitic\n",
      "theophanies, its pictorial narration, its primitive morality, into the terms of contemporary\n",
      "ethical or political or economic principles. Take, for instance, the account of the miracle\n",
      "of Moses and the Burning Bush. The preacher will point out that Moses saw a bush that burned\n",
      "and burned and that, unlike most furze bushes of those upland pastures which were ignited by\n",
      "the hot Syrian sun, was not consumed. It was this enduring quality of the bush that interested\n",
      "him. Thus Moses showed the first characteristic of genius, namely, capacity for accurate and\n",
      "discriminating observation. And he coupled this with the scientific habit of mind. For he said,\n",
      "\"I will now turn aside and see why!\" Thus did he propose to pierce behind the event to the\n",
      "cause of the event, behind the movement to the principle of the movement. What a modern man\n",
      "this Moses was! It seems almost too good to be true!\n",
      "\n",
      "But as yet we have merely scratched the surface of the story. For he took his shoes from off\n",
      "his feet when he inspected this new phenomenon, feeling instinctively that he was on holy ground.\n",
      "Thus there mingled with his scientific curiosity the second great quality of genius, which\n",
      "is reverence. There was no complacency here but an approach to life at once eager and humble;\n",
      "keen yet teachable and mild. And now behold what happens! As a result of this combination of\n",
      "qualities there came to Moses the vision of what he might do to lead his oppressed countrymen\n",
      "out of their industrial bondage. Whereupon he displayed the typical human reaction and cried,\n",
      "\"Who am I, that I should go unto Pharoah or that I should lead the children of Israel out of\n",
      "Egypt!\" My brother Aaron, who is an eloquent person--and as it turned out later also a specious\n",
      "one--is far better suited for this undertaking. Thus he endeavored to evade the task and cried,\n",
      "\"Let someone else do it!\" Having thus expounded the word of God (!) the sermon proceeds to\n",
      "its final division in the application of this shrewd and practical wisdom to some current event\n",
      "or parochial situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, such preaching is indubitably effective and not wholly illegitimate. Its technique is\n",
      "easily acquired. It makes us realize that the early Church Fathers, who displayed a truly appalling\n",
      "ingenuity in allegorizing the Old Testament and who found \"types\" of Christ and His Church\n",
      "in frankly sensual Oriental wedding songs, have many sturdy descendants among us to this very\n",
      "hour! Such preaching gives picturesqueness and color, it provides the necessary sugar coating\n",
      "to the large pill of practical and ethical exhortation. To be sure, it does not sound like\n",
      "the preaching of our fathers. The old sermon titles--\"Suffering with Christ that we may be\n",
      "also glorified with Him,\" for instance--seem very far away from it. Nor is it to be supposed\n",
      "that this is what its author intended the story we have been using to convey nor that these\n",
      "were the reactions that it aroused in the breasts of its original hearers. But as the sermonizer\n",
      "would doubtless go on to remark, there is a certain universal quality in all great literature,\n",
      "and genius builds better than it knows, and so each man can draw his own water of refreshment\n",
      "from these great wells of the past. And indeed nothing is more amazing or disconcerting than\n",
      "the mutually exclusive notions, the apparently opposing truths, which can be educed by this\n",
      "method, from one and the same passage of Scripture! There is scarcely a chapter in all the\n",
      "Old Testament, and to a less degree in the New Testament, which may not be thus ingeniously\n",
      "transmogrified to meet almost any homiletical emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I may as well confess that I have preached this kind of sermon lo! these many years ad\n",
      "infinitum and I doubt not ad nauseam. We have all used in this way the flaming rhetoric of\n",
      "the Hebrew prophets until we think of them chiefly as indicters of a social order. They were\n",
      "not chiefly this but something quite different and more valuable, namely, religious geniuses.\n",
      "First-rate preaching would deal with Amos as the pioneer in ethical monotheism, with Hosea\n",
      "as the first poet of the divine grace, with Jeremiah as the herald of the possibility of each\n",
      "man's separate and personal communion with the living God. But, of course, such religious preaching,\n",
      "dealing with great doctrines of faith, would have a kind of large remoteness about it; it would\n",
      "pay very little attention to the incidents of the story, and indeed, would tend to be hardly\n",
      "expository at all, but rather speculative and doctrinal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that brings us to the theme of this final discussion. For I am one of those who believe\n",
      "that great preaching is doctrinal preaching and that it is particularly needed at this hour.\n",
      "The comparative neglect of the New Testament in favor of the Old in contemporary preaching;\n",
      "the use and nature of the expository method--no less than the unworshipful character of our\n",
      "services--appear to me to offer a final and conclusive proof of the unreligious overhumanistic\n",
      "emphases of our interpretation of religion. And if we are to have a religious revival, then\n",
      "it seems to me worshipful services must be accompanied by speculative preaching and I doubt\n",
      "if the one can be nobly maintained without the other. For we saw that worship is the direct\n",
      "experience of the Absolute through high and concentrated feeling. Even so speculative and,\n",
      "in general, doctrinal preaching is the same return to first principles and to ultimate values\n",
      "in the realm of ideas. It turns away from the immediate, the practical, the relative to the\n",
      "final and absolute in the domain of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, obviously, then, devout services and doctrinal preaching should go together. No high and\n",
      "persistent emotions can be maintained without clear thinking to nourish and steady them. There\n",
      "is in doctrinal preaching a certain indifference to immediate issues; to detailed applications.\n",
      "It deals, by its nature, with comprehensive and abstract rather than local and concrete thinking;\n",
      "with inclusive feeling, transcendent aspiration. It does not try to pietize the ordinary, commercial\n",
      "and domestic affairs of men. Instead it deals with the highest questions and perceptions of\n",
      "human life; argues from those sublime hypotheses which are the very subsoil of the religious\n",
      "temperament and understanding. It deals with those aspects of human life which indeed include,\n",
      "but include because they transcend, the commercial and domestic, the professional and political\n",
      "affairs of daily living. We have been insisting in these chapters that it is that portion of\n",
      "human need and experience which lies between the knowable and the unknowable with which it\n",
      "is the preacher's chief province to deal. Doctrinal preaching endeavors to give form and relations\n",
      "to its intuitions and high desires, its unattainable longings and insights. There is a native\n",
      "alliance between the doctrine of Immanence and expository preaching. For the office of both\n",
      "is to give us the God of this world in the affairs of the moment. There is a native alliance\n",
      "between expository preaching and humanism which very largely accounts for the latter's popularity.\n",
      "For expository preaching, as at present practiced, deals mostly with ethical and practical\n",
      "issues, with the setting of the house of this world in order. There is also a native and majestic\n",
      "alliance between the idea of transcendence and doctrinal preaching and between the facts of\n",
      "the religious experience and the content of speculative philosophy. Not pragmatism but pure\n",
      "metaphysics is the native language of the mind when it moves in the spiritual world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am aware that already I have lost my reader's sympathy. You do not desire to preach doctrinal\n",
      "sermons and while you may read with amiable patience and faintly smiling complacency this discussion,\n",
      "you have no intention of following its advice. We tend to think that doctrinal sermons are\n",
      "outmoded--old-fashioned and unpopular--and we dread as we dread few other things, not being\n",
      "up to date. Besides, doctrinal preaching offers little of that opportunity which is found in\n",
      "expository and yet more in topical preaching for exploiting our own personalities. Some of\n",
      "us are young. It is merely a polite way of saying that we are egotistical. We know in our secret\n",
      "heart of hearts that the main thing that we have to give the world is our own new, fresh selves\n",
      "with their corrected and arresting understanding of the world. We are modestly yet eagerly\n",
      "ready to bestow that gift of ours upon the waiting congregation. One of the few compensations\n",
      "of growing old is that, as the hot inner fires burn lower, this self-absorption lessens and\n",
      "we become disinterested and judicial observers of life and find so much pleasure in other people's\n",
      "successes and so much wisdom in other folk's ideas. But not so for youth; it isn't what the\n",
      "past or the collective mind and heart have formulated: it's what you've got to say that interests\n",
      "you. Hence it is probably true that doctrinal preaching, in the very nature of things, makes\n",
      "no strong appeal to men who are beginning the ministry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are other objections which are more serious, because inherent in the very genius\n",
      "of doctrinal preaching itself. First: such preaching is more or less remote from contemporary\n",
      "and practical issues. It deals with thought, not actions; understanding rather than efficiency;\n",
      "principles rather than applications. It moves among the basic concepts of the religious life;\n",
      "deals with matters beyond and above and without the tumultuous issues of the moment. So it\n",
      "follows that doctrinal preaching has an air of detachment, almost of seclusion from the world;\n",
      "the preacher brings his message from some pale world of ideas to this quick world of action.\n",
      "And we are afraid of this detachment, the abstract and theoretical nature of the thinker's sermon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the fear is not well grounded. What is the use of preaching social service to the almost\n",
      "total neglect of setting forth the intellectual and emotional concept of the servant? It is\n",
      "the quality of the doer which determines the value of the deed. Why keep on insisting upon\n",
      "being good if our hearers have never been carefully instructed in the nature and the sanctions\n",
      "of goodness? Has not the trouble with most of our political and moral reform been that we have\n",
      "had a passion for it but very little science of it? How can we know the ways of godliness if\n",
      "we take God Himself for granted? No: our chief business, as preachers, is to preach the content\n",
      "rather than the application of the truth. Not many people are interested in trying to find\n",
      "the substance of the truth. It is hated as impractical by the multitude of the impatient, and\n",
      "despised as old-fashioned by the get-saved-quick reformers. Nevertheless we must find out the\n",
      "distinctions between divine and human, right and wrong, and why they are what they are, and\n",
      "what is the good of it all. There is no more valuable service which the preacher can render\n",
      "his community than to deliberately seclude himself from continual contact with immediate issues\n",
      "and dwell on the eternal verities. When Darwin published The Descent of Man at the end of the\n",
      "Franco-Prussian War, the London Times took him severely to task for his absorption in purely\n",
      "scientific interests and hypothetical issues. \"When the foundations of property and the established\n",
      "order were threatened with the fires of the Paris Commune; when the Tuileries were burning--how\n",
      "could a British subject be occupying himself with speculations in natural science in no wise\n",
      "calculated to bring aid or comfort to those who had a stake in the country!\" Well, few of us\n",
      "imagine today that Darwin would have been wise to have exchanged the seclusion and the impractical\n",
      "hours of the study for the office or the camp, the market or the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the same fear of occupying ourselves with central and abstract matters still obsesses us.\n",
      "At the Quadrennial Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church held recently at Des Moines,\n",
      "thirty-four bishops submitted an address in which they said among other things: \"Of course,\n",
      "the church must stand in unflinching, uncompromising denunciation of all violations of laws,\n",
      "against all murderous child labor, all foul sweat shops, all unsafe mines, all deadly tenements,\n",
      "all excessive hours for those who toil, all profligate luxuries, all standards of wage and\n",
      "life below the living standard, all unfairness and harshness of conditions, all brutal exactions,\n",
      "whether of the employer or union, all overlordships, whether of capital or labor, all godless\n",
      "profiteering, whether in food, clothing, profits or wages, against all inhumanity, injustice\n",
      "and blighting inequality, against all class-minded men who demand special privileges or exceptions\n",
      "on behalf of their class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These are all vital matters, yet I cannot believe that it is the church's chief business thus\n",
      "to turn her energies to the problems of the material world. This would be a stupendous program,\n",
      "even if complete in itself; as an item in a program it becomes almost a reductio ad absurdum.\n",
      "The Springfield Republican in an editorial comment upon it said: \"It fairly invites the question\n",
      "whether the church is not in some danger of trying to do too much. The fund of energy available\n",
      "for any human undertaking is not unlimited; energy turned in one direction must of necessity\n",
      "be withdrawn from another and energy diffused in many directions cannot be concentrated. Count\n",
      "the adjectives--'murderous,' 'foul,' 'unsafe,' 'deadly,' 'excessive,' 'profligate,' 'brutal,'\n",
      "'godless,' 'blighting'--does not each involve research, investigation, comparison, analysis,\n",
      "deliberation, a heavy tax upon the intellectual resources of the church if any result worth\n",
      "having is to be obtained? Can this energy be found without subtracting energy from some other\n",
      "sphere?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gravest problems of the world are not found here. They are found in the decline of spiritual\n",
      "understanding, the decay of moral standards, the growth of the vindictive and unforgiving spirit,\n",
      "the lapse from charity, the overweening pride of the human heart. With these matters the church\n",
      "must chiefly deal; to their spiritual infidelity she must bring a spiritual message; to their\n",
      "poor thinking she must bring the wisdom of the eternal. This task, preventive not remedial,\n",
      "is her characteristic one. Is it not worth while to remember that the great religious leaders\n",
      "have generally ignored contemporary social problems? So have the great artists who are closely\n",
      "allied to them. Neither William Shakespeare nor Leonardo da Vinci were reformers; neither Gautama\n",
      "nor the Lord Jesus had much to say about the actual international economic and political readjustments\n",
      "which were as pressing in their day as ours. They were content to preach the truth, sure that\n",
      "it, once understood, would set men free.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a second reason why we dislike doctrinal preaching is because we confound it with dogmatic\n",
      "preaching. Doctrinal sermons are those which deal with the philosophy of religion. They expound\n",
      "or defend or relate the intellectual statements, the formulae of religion. Such discourses\n",
      "differ essentially from dogmatic sermonizing. For what is a doctrine? A doctrine is an intellectual\n",
      "formulation of an experience. Suppose a man receives a new influx of moral energy and spiritual\n",
      "insight, through reading the Bible, through trying to pray, through loving and meditating upon\n",
      "the Lord Jesus. That experience isn't a speculative proposition, it isn't a faith or an hypothesis;\n",
      "it's a fact. Like the man in the Johannine record the believer says, \"Whether he be a sinner\n",
      "I know not: but one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let this new experience of moral power and spiritual insight express itself, as it normally\n",
      "will, in a more holy and more useful life, in the appropriate terms of action. There you get\n",
      "that confession of experience which we call character. Or let it express itself in the appropriate\n",
      "emotions of joy and awe and reverence so that, like Ray Palmer, the convert writes an immortal\n",
      "hymn, or a body of converts like the early church produces the Te Deum. There is the confession\n",
      "of experience in worship. Or let a man filled with this new life desire to understand it; see\n",
      "what its implications are regarding the nature of God, the nature of man, the place of Christ\n",
      "in the scale of created or uncreated Being. Let him desire to thus conserve and interpret that\n",
      "he may transmit this new experience. Then he will begin to define it and to reduce it, for\n",
      "brevity and clearness, to some abstract and compact formula. Thus he will make a confession\n",
      "of experience in doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctrines, then, are not arbitrary but natural, not accidental but essential. They are the\n",
      "hypotheses regarding the eternal nature of things drawn from the data of our moral and spiritual\n",
      "experience. They are to religion just what the science of electricity is to a trolley car,\n",
      "or what the formula of evolution is to natural science, or what the doctrine of the conservation\n",
      "of energy is, or was, to physics. Doctrines are signposts; they are placards, index fingers,\n",
      "notices summing up and commending the proved essences of religious experience. Two things are\n",
      "always true of sound doctrine. First: it is not considered to have primary value; its worth\n",
      "is in the experience to which it witnesses. Second: it is not fixed but flexible and progressive.\n",
      "Someone has railed at theology, defining it as the history of discarded errors. That is a truth\n",
      "and a great compliment and the definition holds good of the record of any other science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if doctrines are signposts, dogmas are old and now misleading milestones. For what is\n",
      "a dogma? It may be one of two things. Usually it is a doctrine that has forgotten that it ever\n",
      "had a history; a formula which once had authority because it was a genuine interpretation of\n",
      "experience but which now is so outmoded in fashion of thought, or so maladjusted to our present\n",
      "scale of values, as to be no longer clearly related to experience and is therefore accepted\n",
      "merely on command, or on the prestige of its antiquity. Or it may be a doctrine promulgated\n",
      "ex cathedra, not because religious experience produced it, but because ecclesiastical expediencies\n",
      "demand it. Thus, to illustrate the first sort of dogma, there was once a doctrine of the Virgin\n",
      "Birth. Men found, as they still do, both God and man in Jesus; they discovered when they followed\n",
      "Him their own real humanity and true divinity. They tried to explain and formalize the experience\n",
      "and made a doctrine which, for the circle of ideas and the extent of the factual knowledge\n",
      "of the times, was both reasonable and valuable. The experience still remains, but the doctrine\n",
      "is no longer psychologically or biologically credible. It no longer offers a tenable explanation;\n",
      "it is not a valuable or illuminating interpretation. Hence if we hold it at all today, it is\n",
      "either for sentiment or for the sake of mere tradition, namely, for reasons other than its\n",
      "intellectual usefulness or its inherent intelligibility. So held it passes over from doctrine\n",
      "into dogma. Or take, as an example of the second sort, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception,\n",
      "promulgated by Pius IX in the year 1854, and designed to strengthen the prestige of the Papal\n",
      "See among the Catholic powers of Europe and to prolong its hold upon its temporal possessions.\n",
      "De Cesare describes the promulgation of the dogma as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The festival on that day, December 8, 1854, sacred to the Virgin, was magnificent. After chanting\n",
      "the Gospel, first in Latin, then in Greek, Cardinal Macchi, deacon of the Sacred College, together\n",
      "with the senior archbishops and bishops present, all approached the Papal throne, pronouncing\n",
      "these words in Latin, 'Deign, most Holy Father, to lift your Apostolic voice and pronounce\n",
      "the dogmatic Decree of the Immaculate Conception, on account of which there will be praise\n",
      "in heaven and rejoicings on earth.' The Pope replying, stated that he welcomed the wish of\n",
      "the Sacred College, the episcopate, the clergy, and declared it was essential first of all\n",
      "to invoke the help of the Holy Spirit. So saying he intoned in Veni Creator, chanted in chorus\n",
      "by all present. The chant concluded, amid a solemn silence Pius IX's finely modulated voice\n",
      "read the following Decree:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'It shall be Dogma, that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instant of the Conception,\n",
      "by singular privilege and grace of God, in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour\n",
      "of mankind, was preserved from all stain of original sin.' The senior cardinal then prayed\n",
      "the Pope to make this Decree public, and, amid the roar of cannon from Fort St. Angelo and\n",
      "the festive ringing of church bells, the solemn act was accomplished.'\"[42] Here is an assertion\n",
      "regarding Mary's Conception which has only the most tenuous connection with religious experience\n",
      "and which was pronounced for ecclesiastical and political reasons. Here we have dogma at its\n",
      "worst. Here, indeed, it is so bad as to resemble many of the current political and economic\n",
      "pronunciamentos!\n",
      "\n",
      "[Footnote 42: The Last Days of Papal Rome, pp. 127 ff.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, nobody wants dogmatic preaching, but there is nothing that we need more than we do doctrinal\n",
      "preaching and nothing which is more interesting. The specialization of knowledge has assigned\n",
      "to the preacher of religion a definite sphere. No amount of secondary expertness in politics\n",
      "or economics or social reform or even morals can atone for the abandonment of our own province.\n",
      "We are set to think about and expound religion and if we give that up we give up our place\n",
      "in a learned profession. Moreover, the new conditions of the modern world make doctrine imperative.\n",
      "That world is distinguished by its free inquiry, its cultivation of the scientific method,\n",
      "its abandonment of obscuranticisms and ambiguities. It demands, then, devout and holy thinking\n",
      "from us. Who would deny that the revival of intellectual authority and leadership in matters\n",
      "of religion is terribly needed in our day? Sabatier is right in saying that a religion without\n",
      "doctrine is a self-contradictory idea. Harnack is not wrong in saying that a Christianity without\n",
      "it is inconceivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I know you are thinking in your hearts, Well, what inconsistency this man shows! For\n",
      "a whole book he has been insisting on the prime values of imagination and feeling in religion\n",
      "and now he concludes with a plea for the thinker. But it is not so inconsistent as it appears.\n",
      "It is just because we do believe that the discovery, the expression and the rewards of religion\n",
      "lie chiefly in the superrational and poetic realms that therefore we want this intellectual\n",
      "content to accompany it, not supersede it, as a balancing influence, a steadying force. There\n",
      "are grave perils in worshipful services corresponding to their supreme values. Mystical preaching\n",
      "has the defects of its virtues and too often sinks into that vague sentimentalism which is\n",
      "the perversion of its excellence. How insensibly sometimes does high and precious feeling degenerate\n",
      "into a sort of religious hysteria! It needs then to be always tested and corrected by clear\n",
      "thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we in no way alter our original insistence that in our realm as preachers, unlike the scientist's\n",
      "realm of the theologians, thought is the handmaid, not the mistress. Our great plea, then,\n",
      "for doctrinal preaching is that by intellectual grappling with the final and speculative problems\n",
      "of religion we do not supersede but feed the emotional life and do not diminish but focus and\n",
      "steady it. It is that you and I may have reserves of feeling--indispensable to great preaching--sincerity\n",
      "and intensity of emotion, that disciplined imagination which is genius, that restrained passion\n",
      "which is art, and that our congregations may have the same, that we must strive for intellectual\n",
      "power, must do the preaching that gives people something to think about. These are the religious\n",
      "and devout reasons why we value intellectual honesty, precision of utterance, reserve of statement,\n",
      "logical and coherent thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are come, then, to the conclusion of our discussions. They have been intended to restore\n",
      "a neglected emphasis upon the imaginative and transcendent as distinguished from the ethical\n",
      "and humanistic aspects of the religious life. They have tried to show that the reaching out\n",
      "by worship to this \"otherness\" of God and to the ultimate in life is man's deepest hunger and\n",
      "the one we are chiefly set to feed. I am sure that the chief ally of the experience of the\n",
      "transcendence of God and the cultivation of the worshipful faculties in man is to be found\n",
      "in severe and speculative thinking. I believe our almost unmixed passion for piety, for action,\n",
      "for practical efficiency, betrays us. It indicates that we are trying to manufacture effects\n",
      "to conceal the absence of causes. We may look for a religious revival when men have so meditated\n",
      "upon and struggled with the fundamental ideas of religion that they feel profoundly its eternal\n",
      "mysteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, we have the best historical grounds for our position. Sometimes great religious\n",
      "movements have been begun by unlearned and uncritical men like Peter the hermit or John Bunyan\n",
      "or Moody. But we must not infer from this that religious insight is naturally repressed by\n",
      "clear thinking or fostered by ignorance. Dr. Francis Greenwood Peabody has pointed out that\n",
      "the great religious epochs in Christian history are also epochs in the history of theology.\n",
      "The Pauline epistles, the Confessions of Augustine, the Meditations of Anselm, the Simple Method\n",
      "of How to Pray of Luther, the Regula of Loyola, the Monologen of Schleiermacher, these are\n",
      "all manuals of the devout life, they belong in the distinctively religious world of supersensuous\n",
      "and the transcendent, and one thing which accounts for them is that the men who produced them\n",
      "were religious geniuses because they were also theologians.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Footnote 43: See the \"Call to Theology,\" Har. Theo. Rev., vol. I, no. 1, pp. 1 ff.]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is to be remembered that we are not saying that the theologian makes the saint. I do not\n",
      "believe that. Devils can believe and tremble; Abelard was no saint. But we are contending that\n",
      "the great saint is extremely likely to be a theologian. Protestantism, Methodism, Tractarianism,\n",
      "were chiefly religious movements, interested in the kind of questions and moved by the sorts\n",
      "of motives which we have been talking about. They all began within the precincts of universities.\n",
      "Moreover, the Lord Jesus, consummate mystic, incomparable artist, was such partly because He\n",
      "was a great theologian as well. His dealings with scribe and Pharisee furnish some of the world's\n",
      "best examples of acute and courageous dialectics. His theological method differed markedly\n",
      "from the academicians of His day. Nevertheless it was noted that He spoke with an extraordinary\n",
      "authority. \"He gave,\" as Dr. Peabody also points out, \"new scope and significance to the thought\n",
      "of God, to the nature of man, to the destiny of the soul, to the meaning of the world. He would\n",
      "have been reckoned among the world's great theologians if other endowments had not given Him\n",

      "to say is that it is to these sorts of excellencies that the preacher aspires. But the life\n",
